<h4>PART I.</h4>

<p>We never thought of Finster St. Mabyn's being
haunted. We really never did.</p>

<p>This may seem strange, but it is absolutely true.
It was such an extremely interesting and curious
place in many ways that it required nothing
extraneous to add to its attractions. Perhaps this
was the reason.</p>

<p>Now-a-days, immediately that you hear of a
house being "very old," the next remark is sure to
be "I hope it is"&mdash;or "is not"&mdash;that depends on
the taste of the speaker&mdash;"haunted".</p>

<p>But Finster was more than very old; it was
<i>ancient</i> and, in a modest way, historical. I will not
take up time by relating its history, however, or
by referring my readers to the chronicles in which
mention of it may be found. Nor shall I yield to
the temptation of describing the room in which a
certain royalty spent one night, if not two or three
nights, four centuries ago, or the tower, now in
ruins, where an even more renowned personage was
imprisoned for several months. All these facts&mdash;or
legends&mdash;have nothing to do with what I have
to tell. Nor, strictly speaking, has Finster itself,
except as a sort of prologue to my narrative.</p>

<p>We heard of the house through friends living in
the same county, though some distance farther inland.
They&mdash;Mr. and Miss Miles, it is convenient
to give their name at once&mdash;knew that we
had been ordered to leave our own home for some
months, to get over the effects of a very trying
visitation of influenza, and that sea-air was specially
desirable.</p>

<p>We grumbled at this. Seaside places are often
so dull and commonplace. But when we heard of
Finster we grumbled no longer.</p>

<p>"Dull" in a sense it might be, but assuredly not
"commonplace". Janet Miles's description of it,
though she was not particularly clever at description,
read like a fairy tale, or one of Longfellow's
poems.</p>

<p>"A castle by the sea&mdash;how perfect!" we all exclaimed.
"Do, oh, do fix for it, mother!"</p>

<p>The objections were quickly over-ruled. It
was rather isolated, said Miss Miles, standing,
as was not difficult to trace in its name, on a point
of land&mdash;a corner rather&mdash;with sea on two sides.
It had not been lived in, save spasmodically, for
some years, for the late owner was one of those
happy, or unhappy people, who have more houses
than they can use, and the present one was a
minor. Eventually it was to be overhauled and
some additions and alterations made, but the
trustees would be glad to let it at a moderate
rent for some months, and had intended putting
it into some agents' hands when Mr. Miles
happened to meet one of them, who mentioned
it to him. There was nothing against it; it was
absolutely healthy. But the furniture was old and
shabby, and there was none too much of it. If
we wanted to have visitors we should certainly
require to add to it. This, however, could easily
be done, our informant went on to say. There
was a very good upholsterer and furniture dealer
at Raxtrew, the nearest town, who was in the
habit of hiring out things to the officers at the
fort. "Indeed," she added, "we often pick up
charming old pieces of furniture from him for
next to nothing, so you could both hire and
buy."</p>

<p>Of course, we should have visitors&mdash;and our
own house would not be the worse for some
additional chairs and tables here and there, in
place of some excellent monstrosities Phil and
Nugent and I had persuaded mother to get
rid of.</p>

<p>"If I go down to spy the land with father,"
I said, "I shall certainly go to the furniture
dealer's and have a good look about me."</p>

<p>I did go with father. I was nineteen&mdash;it is
four years ago&mdash;and a capable sort of girl. Then
I was the only one who had not been ill, and
mother had been the worst of all, mother and
Dormy&mdash;poor little chap&mdash;for <i>he</i> nearly died.</p>

<p>He is the youngest of us&mdash;we are four boys
and two girls. Sophy was then fifteen. My
own name is Leila.</p>

<p>If I attempted to give any idea of the impression
Finster St. Mabyn's made upon us, I should
go on for hours. It simply took our breath
away. It really felt like going back a few centuries
merely to enter within the walls and gaze
round you. And yet we did not see it to any
advantage, so at least said the two Miles's who
were our guides. It was a gloomy day, with the
feeling of rain not far off, early in April. It
might have been November, though it was not
cold.</p>

<p>"You can scarcely imagine what it is on a
bright day," said Janet, eager, as people always
are in such circumstances, to show off her
<i>trouvaille</i>. "The lights and shadows are so
exquisite."</p>

<p>"I love it as it is," I said. "I don't think
I shall ever regret having seen it first on a grey
day. It is just perfect."</p>

<p>She was pleased at my admiration, and did her
utmost to facilitate matters. Father was taken
with the place, too, I could see, but he hummed
and hawed a good deal about the bareness of the
rooms&mdash;the bedrooms especially. So Janet and I
went into it at once in a business-like way, making
lists of the actually necessary additions, which did
not prove very formidable after all.</p>

<p>"Hunter will manage all that <i>easily</i>," said Miss
Miles, upon which father gave in&mdash;I believe he
had meant to do so all the time. The rent was
really so low that a little furniture-hire could be
afforded, I suggested. And father agreed.</p>

<p>"It is extremely low," he said, "for a place
possessing so many advantages."</p>

<p>But even then it did not occur to any of us to
suggest "suspiciously low".</p>

<p>We had the Miles's guarantee for it all, to begin
with. Had there been any objection they must
have known it.</p>

<p>We spent the night with them and the next
morning at the furniture dealer's. He was a
quick, obliging little man, and took in the situation
at a glance. And <i>his</i> terms were so moderate that
father said to me amiably: "There are some quaint
odds and ends here, Leila. You might choose a
few things, to use at Finster in the first place, and
then to take home with us."</p>

<p>I was only too ready to profit by the permission,
and with Janet's help a few charmingly quaint
chairs and tables, a three-cornered wall cabinet, and
some other trifles were soon put aside for us. We
were just leaving, when at one end of the
shop some tempting-looking draperies caught my
eye.</p>

<p>"What are these?" I asked the upholsterer.
"Curtains! Why, this is real old tapestry!"</p>

<p>The obliging Hunter drew out the material in
question.</p>

<p>"They are not exactly curtains, miss," he said.
"I thought they would make nice <i>porti&egrave;res</i>. You
see the tapestry is set into cloth. It was so frail
when I got it that it was the only thing to do with
it."</p>

<p>He had managed it very ingeniously. Two
panels, so to say, of old tapestry, very charming
in tone, had been lined and framed with dull green
cloth, making a very good pair of <i>porti&egrave;res</i> indeed.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" I cried, "do let us have these.
There are sure to be draughty doors at Finster,
and afterwards they would make <i>perfect "porti&egrave;res"</i>
for the two side doors in the hall at home."</p>

<p>Father eyed the tapestry appreciatively, but first
prudently inquired the price. It seemed higher in
proportion than Hunter's other charges.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," he said half apologetically, "the
panels are real antique work, though so much the
worse for wear."</p>

<p>"Where did they come from?" asked father.</p>

<p>Hunter hesitated.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, sir," he replied, "I was
asked not to name the party that I bought it from.
It seems a pity to part with <i>h</i>eir-looms, but&mdash;it
happens sometimes&mdash;I bought several things together
of a family quite lately. The <i>porti&egrave;res</i>
have only come out of the workroom this morning.
We hurried on with them to stop them fraying
more&mdash;you see where they were before, they must
have been nailed to the wall."</p>

<p>Janet Miles, who was something of a connoisseur,
had been examining the tapestry.</p>

<p>"It is well worth what he asks," she said, in a
low voice. "You don't often come across such
tapestry in England."</p>

<p>So the bargain was struck, and Hunter promised
to see all that we had chosen, both purchased and
hired, delivered at Finster the week before we
proposed to come.</p>

<p>Nothing interfered with our plans. By the end
of the month we found ourselves at our temporary
home&mdash;all of us except Nat, our third brother, who
was at school. Dormer, the small boy, still did
lessons with Sophy's governess. The two older
"boys," as we called them, happened to be at
home from different reasons&mdash;one, Nugent, on
leave from India; Phil, forced to miss a term at
college through an attack of the same illness which
had treated mother and Dormy so badly.</p>

<p>But now that everybody was well again, and
going to be very much better, thanks to Finster
air, we thought the ill wind had brought us some
very distinct good. It would not have been half
such fun had we not been a large family party to
start with, and before we had been a week at the
place we had added to our numbers by the first
detachment of the guests we had invited.</p>

<p>It was not a very large house; besides ourselves
we had not room for more than three or four
others. For some of the rooms&mdash;those on the top
story&mdash;were really too dilapidated to suit any one
but rats&mdash;"rats or ghosts," said some one laughingly
one day, when we had been exploring them.</p>

<p>Afterwards the words returned to my memory.</p>

<p>We had made ourselves very comfortable, thanks
to the invaluable Hunter. And every day the
weather grew milder and more spring-like. The
woods on the inland side were full of primroses.
It promised to be a lovely season.</p>

<p>There was a gallery along one side of the house,
which soon became a favourite resort; it made a
pleasant lounging-place, in the day-time especially,
though less so in the evening, as the fireplace at
one end warmed it but imperfectly, and besides
this it was difficult to light up. It was draughty,
too, as there was a superfluity of doors, two of
which, one at each end, we at once condemned.
They were not needed, as the one led by a very
long spiral staircase, to the unused attic rooms, the
other to the kitchen and offices. And when we
did have afternoon tea in the gallery, it was easy
to bring it through the dining or drawing-rooms,
long rooms, lighted at their extreme ends, which
ran parallel to the gallery lengthways, both of
which had a door opening on to it as well as from
the hall on the other side. For all the principal
rooms at Finster were on the first-floor, not on
the ground-floor.</p>

<p>The closing of these doors got rid of a great
deal of draught, and, as I have said, the weather
was really mild and calm.</p>

<p>One afternoon&mdash;I am trying to begin at the
beginning of our strange experiences; even at
the risk of long-windedness it seems better to
do so&mdash;we were all assembled in the gallery at
tea-time. The "children," as we called Sophy and
Dormer, much to Sophy's disgust, and their governess,
were with us, for rules were relaxed at
Finster, and Miss Larpent was a great favourite
with us all.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sophy gave an exclamation of annoyance.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said, "I wish you would speak
to Dormer. He has thrown over my tea-cup&mdash;only
look at my frock!" "If you cannot sit
still," she added, turning herself to the boy, "I
don't think you should be allowed to come to tea
here."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Dormy?" said mother.</p>

<p>Dormer was standing beside Sophy, looking
very guilty, and rather white.</p>

<p>"Mamma," he said, "I was only drawing a
chair out. It got so dreadfully cold where I was
sitting, I really could not stay there," and he
shivered slightly.</p>

<p>He had been sitting with his back to one of
the locked-up doors. Phil, who was nearest,
moved his hand slowly across the spot.</p>

<p>"You are fanciful, Dormy," he said, "there is
really no draught whatever."</p>

<p>This did not satisfy mother.</p>

<p>"He must have got a chill, then," she said, and
she went on to question the child as to what he
had been doing all day, for, as I have said, he was
still delicate.</p>

<p>But he persisted that he was quite well, and no
longer cold.</p>

<p>"It wasn't exactly a draught," he said, "it
was&mdash;oh! just icy, all of a sudden. I've felt it
before&mdash;sitting in that chair."</p>

<p>Mother said no more, and Dormer went on
with his tea, and when bed-time came he seemed
just as usual, so that her anxiety faded. But she
made thorough investigation as to the possibility
of any draught coming up from the back stairs,
with which this door communicated. None was
to be discovered&mdash;the door fitted fairly well,
and beside this, Hunter had tacked felt round
the edges&mdash;furthermore, one of the thick heavy
<i>porti&egrave;res</i> had been hung in front.</p>

<p>An evening or two later we were sitting in the
drawing room after dinner, when a cousin who
was staying with us suddenly missed her fan.</p>

<p>"Run and fetch Muriel's fan, Dormy," I said,
for Muriel felt sure it had slipped under the dinner
table. None of the men had as yet joined us.</p>

<p>"Why, where are you going, child?" as he
turned towards the farther door. "It is much
quicker by the gallery."</p>

<p>He said nothing, but went out, walking rather
slowly, by the gallery door. And in a few minutes
he returned, fan in hand, but by the <i>other</i> door.</p>

<p>He was a sensitive child, and though I wondered
what he had got into his head against the gallery,
I did not say anything before the others. But
when, soon after, Dormy said "Good night," and
went off to bed, I followed him.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Leila?" he said rather
crossly.</p>

<p>"Don't be vexed, child," I said. "I can see
there is something the matter. Why do you not
like the gallery?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, but I had laid my hand on his
shoulder, and he knew I meant to be kind.</p>

<p>"Leila," he said, with a glance round, to be sure
that no one was within hearing&mdash;we were standing,
he and I, near the inner dining-room door, which
was open&mdash;"you'll laugh at me, but&mdash;there's something
queer there&mdash;sometimes!"</p>

<p>"What? And how do you mean 'sometimes'?"
I asked, with a slight thrill at his tone.</p>

<p>"I mean not always, I've felt it several times&mdash;there
was the cold the day before yesterday, and
besides that, I've felt a&mdash;a sort of <i>breaving</i>"&mdash;Dormy
was not perfect in his "th's"&mdash;"like somebody
very unhappy."</p>

<p>"Sighing?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Like sighing in a whisper," he replied, "and
that's always near the door. But last week&mdash;no,
not so long ago, it was on Monday&mdash;I went round
that way when I was going to bed. I didn't want
to be silly. But it was moonlight&mdash;and&mdash;Leila, a
shadow went all along the wall on that side, and
stopped at the door. I saw it waggling about&mdash;its
<i>hands</i>," and here he shivered&mdash;"on that funny
curtain that hangs up, as if it were feeling for a
minute or two, and then<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"It just went out," he said simply. "But it's
moonlight again to-night, sister, and I daren't see
it again. I just <i>daren't</i>."</p>

<p>"But you did go to the dining-room that way,"
I reminded him.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I shut my eyes and ran, and even
then I felt as if something cold was behind me."</p>

<p>"Dormy, dear," I said, a good deal concerned,
"I do think it's your fancy. You are not <i>quite</i>
well yet, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," he replied sturdily. "I'm not a
bit frightened anywhere else. I sleep in a room
alone you know. It's not <i>me</i>, sister, its somefing
in the gallery."</p>

<p>"Would you be frightened to go there with me
now? We can run through the dining-room;
there's no one to see us," and I turned in that
direction as I spoke.</p>

<p>Again my little brother hesitated.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you if you'll hold hands," he said,
"but I'll shut my eyes. And I won't open them
till you tell me there's no shadow on the wall.
You must tell me truly."</p>

<p>"But there must be some shadows," I said, "in
this bright moonlight, trees and branches, or even
clouds scudding across&mdash;something of that kind is
what you must have seen, dear."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, no, of course I wouldn't mind that. I
know the difference. No&mdash;you couldn't mistake.
It goes along, right along, in a creeping way, and
then at the door its hands come farther out, and it
<i>feels</i>."</p>

<p>"Is it like a man or a woman?" I said, beginning
to feel rather creepy myself.</p>

<p>"I think it's most like a rather little man," he
replied, "but I'm not sure. Its head has got
something fuzzy about it&mdash;oh, I know, like a
sticking out wig. But lower down it seems
wrapped up, like in a cloak. Oh, it's <i>horrid</i>."</p>

<p>And again he shivered&mdash;it was quite time all
this nightmare nonsense was put out of his poor
little head.</p>

<p>I took his hand and held it firmly; we went
through the dining-room. Nothing could have
looked more comfortable and less ghostly. For
the lights were still burning on the table, and the
flowers in their silver bowls, some wine gleaming
in the glasses, the fruit and pretty dishes, made a
pleasant glow of colour. It certainly seemed a
curiously sudden contrast when we found ourselves
in the gallery beyond, cold and unillumined, save
by the pale moonlight streaming through the unshuttered
windows. For the door closed with a
bang as we passed through&mdash;the gallery <i>was</i> a
draughty place.</p>

<p>Dormy's hold tightened.</p>

<p>"Sister," he whispered, "I've shut my eyes
now. You must stand with your back to the
windows&mdash;between them, or else you'll think it's
our own shadows&mdash;and watch."</p>

<p>I did as he said, and I had not long to wait.</p>

<p>It came&mdash;from the farther end, the second condemned
door, whence the winding stair mounted
to the attics&mdash;it seemed to begin or at least take
form there. Creeping along, just as Dormy said&mdash;stealthily
but steadily&mdash;right down to the other
extremity of the long room. And then it grew
blacker&mdash;more concentrated&mdash;and out from the
vague outline came two bony hands, and, as the
child had said, too, you could see that they were
<i>feeling</i>&mdash;all over the upper part of the door.</p>

<p>I stood and watched. I wondered afterwards at
my own courage, if courage it was. It was the
shadow of a small man, I felt sure. The head
seemed large in proportion, and&mdash;yes&mdash;it&mdash;the
original of the shadow&mdash;was evidently covered by
an antique wig. Half mechanically I glanced
round&mdash;as if in search of the material body that
<i>must</i> be there. But no; there was nothing,
literally <i>nothing</i>, that could throw this extraordinary
shadow.</p>

<p>Of this I was instantly convinced; and here I
may as well say once for all, that never was it
maintained by any one, however previously
sceptical, who had fully witnessed the whole, that
it could be accounted for by ordinary, or, as people
say, "natural" causes. There was this peculiarity
at least about our ghost.</p>

<p>Though I had fast hold of his hand, I had almost
forgotten Dormy&mdash;I seemed in a trance.</p>

<p>Suddenly he spoke, though in a whisper.</p>

<p>"You see it, sister, I know you do," he said.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait a minute, dear," I managed to reply
in the same tone, though I could not have
explained why I waited.</p>

<p>Dormer had said that after a time&mdash;after the
ghastly and apparently fruitless <i>feeling</i> all over the
door&mdash;"it"&mdash;"went out".</p>

<p>I think it was this that I was waiting for. It
was not quite as he had said. The door was in
the extreme corner of the wall, the hinges almost
in the angle, and as the shadow began to move on
again, it <i>looked</i> as if it disappeared; but no, it was
only fainter. My eyes, preternaturally sharpened
by my intense gaze, still saw it, working its way
round the corner, as assuredly no <i>shadow</i> in the
real sense of the word ever did nor could do. I
realised this, and the sense of horror grew all but
intolerable; yet I stood still, clasping the cold little
hand in mine tighter and tighter. And an instinct
of protection of the child gave me strength.
Besides, it was coming on so quickly&mdash;we could
not have escaped&mdash;it was coming, nay, it <i>was behind</i>
us.</p>

<p>"Leila!" gasped Dormy, "the cold&mdash;you feel
it now?"</p>

<p>Yes, truly&mdash;like no icy breath that I had ever
felt before was that momentary but horrible thrill
of utter cold. If it had lasted another second I
think it would have killed us both. But, mercifully,
it passed, in far less time than it has taken me to
tell it, and then we seemed in some strange way to
be released.</p>

<p>"Open your eyes, Dormy," I said, "you won't
see anything, I promise you. I want to rush across
to the dining-room."</p>

<p>He obeyed me. I felt there was time to escape
before that awful presence would again have arrived
at the dining-room door, though it was <i>coming</i>&mdash;ah,
yes, it was coming, steadily pursuing its
ghastly round. And, alas! the dining-room
door was closed. But I kept my nerve to some
extent. I turned the handle without over much
trembling, and in another moment, the door shut
and locked behind us, we stood in safety, looking
at each other, in the bright cheerful room we had
left so short a time ago.</p>

<p><i>Was</i> it so short a time? I said to myself. It
seemed hours!</p>

<p>And through the door open to the hall came
at that moment the sound of cheerful laughing
voices from the drawing-room. Some one was
coming out. It seemed impossible, incredible,
that within a few feet of the matter-of-fact pleasant
material life, this horrible inexplicable drama
should be going on, as doubtless it still was.</p>

<p>Of the two I was now more upset than my
little brother. I was older and "took in" more.
He, boy-like, was in a sense triumphant at having
proved himself correct and no coward, and though
he was still pale, his eyes shone with excitement
and a queer kind of satisfaction.</p>

<p>But before we had done more than look at each
other, a figure appeared at the open doorway. It
was Sophy.</p>

<p>"Leila," she said, "mamma wants to know
what you are doing with Dormy? He is to go
to bed at once. We saw you go out of the room
after him, and then a door banged. Mamma
says if you are playing with him it's very bad for
him so late at night."</p>

<p>Dormy was very quick. He was still holding
my hand, and he pinched it to stop my
replying.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" he said. "I am speaking to Leila
quietly, and she is coming up to my room while
I undress. Good night, Sophy."</p>

<p>"Tell mamma Dormy really wants me," I
added, and then Sophy departed.</p>

<p>"We musn't tell <i>her</i>, Leila," said the boy.
"She'd have 'sterics."</p>

<p>"Whom shall we tell?" I said, for I was
beginning to feel very helpless and upset.</p>

<p>"Nobody, to-night," he replied sensibly.
"You <i>mustn't</i> go in there," and he shivered a
little as he moved his head towards the gallery;
"you're not fit for it, and they'd be wanting you
to. Wait till the morning and then I'd&mdash;I think
I'd tell Philip first. You needn't be frightened
to-night, sister. It won't stop you sleeping. It
didn't me the time I saw it before."</p>

<p>He was right. I slept dreamlessly. It was as
if the intense nervous strain of those few minutes
had utterly exhausted me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>PART II.</h4>

<p>Phil is our soldier brother. And there is nothing
fanciful about <i>him</i>! He is a rock of sturdy common-sense
and unfailing good nature. He was
the very best person to confide our strange secret
to, and my respect for Dormy increased.</p>

<p>We did tell him&mdash;the very next morning. He
listened very attentively, only putting in a question
here and there, and though, of course, he was
incredulous&mdash;had I not been so myself?&mdash;he was
not mocking.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have told no one else," he said,
when we had related the whole as circumstantially
as possible. "You see mother is not very strong
yet, and it would be a pity to bother father, just
when he's taken this place and settled it all. And
for goodness' sake, don't let a breath of it get
about among the servants; there'd be the&mdash;something
to pay, if you did."</p>

<p>"I won't tell anybody," said Dormy.</p>

<p>"Nor shall I," I added. "Sophy is far too
excitable, and if she knew, she would certainly tell
Nannie." Nannie is our old nurse.</p>

<p>"If we tell any one," Philip went on, "that
means," with a rather irritating smile of self-confidence,
"if by any possibility I do not succeed in
making an end of your ghost and we want another
opinion about it, the person to tell would be Miss
Larpent."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I think so, too."</p>

<p>I would not risk irritating him by saying how
convinced I was that conviction awaited <i>him</i> as
surely it had come to myself, and I knew that Miss
Larpent, though far from credulous, was equally
far from stupid scepticism concerning the
mysteries "not dreamt of" in ordinary
"philosophy".</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" I went on.
"You have a theory, I see. Won't you tell me
what it is?"</p>

<p>"I have two," said Phil, rolling up a cigarette
as he spoke. "It is either some queer optical
illusion, partly the effect of some odd reflection
outside&mdash;or it is a clever trick."</p>

<p>"A trick!" I exclaimed; "what <i>possible</i> motive
could there be for a trick?"</p>

<p>Phil shook his head.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "that I cannot at present
say."</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I shall sit up to-night in the gallery and see
for myself."</p>

<p>"Alone?" I exclaimed, with some misgiving.
For big, sturdy fellow as he was, I scarcely liked
to think of him&mdash;of <i>any one</i>&mdash;alone with that awful
thing.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you or Dormy would care to
keep me company," he replied, "and on the whole
I would rather not have you."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do it," said the child honestly,
"not for&mdash;for nothing."</p>

<p>"I shall keep Tim with me," said Philip, "I
would rather have him than any one."</p>

<p>Tim is Phil's bull-dog, and certainly, I agreed,
much better than nobody.</p>

<p>So it was settled.</p>

<p>Dormy and I went to bed unusually early that
night, for as the day wore on we both felt
exceedingly tired. I pleaded a headache, which
was not altogether a fiction, though I repented
having complained at all when I found that poor
mamma immediately began worrying herself with
fears that "after all" I, too, was to fall a victim
to the influenza.</p>

<p>"I shall be all right in the morning," I assured
her.</p>

<p>I knew no further details of Phil's arrangements.
I fell asleep almost at once. I usually
do. And it seemed to me that I had slept a
whole night when I was awakened by a glimmering
light at my door, and heard Philip's
voice speaking softly.</p>

<p>"Are you awake, Lel?" he said, as people
always say when they awake you in any untimely
way. Of course, <i>now</i> I was awake, very much
awake indeed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I exclaimed eagerly, my heart
beginning to beat very fast.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing at all," said my brother,
advancing a little into the room. "I just thought
I'd look in on my way to bed to reassure you.
I have seen <i>nothing</i>, absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>I do not know if I was relieved or disappointed.</p>

<p>"Was it moonlight?" I asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "unluckily the moon did
not come out at all, though it is nearly at the full.
I carried in a small lamp, which made things less
eerie. But I should have preferred the moon."</p>

<p>I glanced up at him. Was it the reflection of
the candle he held, or did he look paler than
usual?</p>

<p>"And," I added suddenly, "did you <i>feel</i>
nothing?"</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it was chilly, certainly," he said. "I
fancy I must have dosed a little, for I did feel
pretty cold once or twice."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" thought I to myself. "And
how about Tim?"</p>

<p>Phil smiled, but not very successfully.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I must confess Tim did not
altogether like it. He started snarling, then he
growled, and finished up with whining in a
decidedly unhappy way. He's rather upset&mdash;poor
old chap!"</p>

<p>And then I saw that the dog was beside
him&mdash;rubbing up close to Philip's legs&mdash;a very
dejected, reproachful Tim&mdash;all the starch taken
out of him.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Phil," I said, turning round on
my pillow. "I'm glad you are satisfied.
To-morrow morning you must tell me which of
your theories holds most water. Good-night,
and many thanks."</p>

<p>He was going to say more, but my manner
for the moment stopped him, and he went off.</p>

<p>Poor old Phil!</p>

<p>We had it out the next morning. He and I
alone. He was <i>not</i> satisfied. Far from it. In the
bottom of his heart I believe it was a strange
yearning for a breath of human companionship,
for the sound of a human voice, that had made
him look in on me the night before.</p>

<p><i>For he had felt the cold passing him.</i></p>

<p>But he was very plucky.</p>

<p>"I'll sit up again to-night, Leila," he said.</p>

<p>"Not to-night," I objected. "This sort of
adventure requires one to be at one's best. If you
take my advice you will go to bed early and have
a good stretch of sleep, so that you will be quite
fresh by to-morrow. There will be a moon for
some nights still."</p>

<p>"Why do you keep harping on the moon?"
said Phil rather crossly, for him.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I have some idea that it is only in
the moonlight that&mdash;that anything is to be <i>seen</i>."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said my brother politely&mdash;he was
certainly rather discomposed&mdash;"we are talking at
cross-purposes. You are satisfied<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Far from satisfied," I interpolated.</p>

<p>"Well, convinced, whatever you like to call
it&mdash;that the whole thing is supernatural, whereas
I am equally sure it is a trick; a clever trick I
allow, though I haven't yet got at the motive
of it."</p>

<p>"You need your nerves to be at their best to
discover a trick of this kind, if a trick it be," I
said quietly.</p>

<p>Philip had left his seat, and walked up and down
the room; his way of doing so gave me a feeling
that he wanted to walk off some unusual consciousness
of irritability. I felt half provoked and half
sorry for him.</p>

<p>At that moment&mdash;we were alone in the drawing-room&mdash;the
door opened, and Miss Larpent came
in.</p>

<p>"I cannot find Sophy," she said, peering about
through her rather short-sighted eyes, which,
nevertheless, see a great deal sometimes; "do you
know where she is?"</p>

<p>"I saw her setting off somewhere with Nugent,"
said Philip, stopping his quarter-deck exercise for
a moment.</p>

<p>"Ah, then it is hopeless. I suppose I
must resign myself to very irregular ways
for a little longer," Miss Larpent replied with
a smile.</p>

<p>She is not young, and not good looking, but she
is gifted with a delightful way of smiling, and she
is&mdash;well, the dearest and almost the wisest of
women.</p>

<p>She looked at Philip as he spoke. She had
known us nearly since our babyhood.</p>

<p>"Is there anything the matter?" she said
suddenly. "You look fagged, Leila, and Philip
seems worried."</p>

<p>I glanced at Philip. He understood me.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I am irritated, and Leila
is<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Miss Larpent.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know&mdash;obstinate, I suppose. Sit
down, Miss Larpent, and hear our story. Leila,
you can tell it."</p>

<p>I did so&mdash;first obtaining a promise of secrecy,
and making Phil relate his own experience.</p>

<p>Our new <i>confidante</i> listened attentively, her face
very grave. When she had heard all, she said
quietly, after a moment's silence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's very strange, very. Philip, if you will
wait till to-morrow night, and I quite agree with
Leila that you had better do so, I will sit up with
you. I have pretty good nerves, and I have
always wanted an experience of that kind."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think it is a trick?" I said
eagerly. I was like Dormer, divided between my
real underlying longing to explain the thing, and
get rid of the horror of it, and a half childish
wish to prove that I had not exaggerated its
ghastliness.</p>

<p>"I will tell you that the day after to-morrow,"
she said. I could not repress a little shiver as she
spoke.</p>

<p>She <i>had</i> good nerves, and she was extremely
sensible.</p>

<p>But I almost blamed myself afterwards for
having acquiesced in the plan. For the effect on
her was very great. They never told me exactly
what happened; "You <i>know</i>," said Miss Larpent.
I imagine their experience was almost precisely
similar to Dormy's and mine, intensified, perhaps,
by the feeling of loneliness. For it was not till all
the rest of the family was in bed that this second
vigil began. It was a bright moonlight night&mdash;they
had the whole thing complete.</p>

<p>It was impossible to throw off the effect; even
in the daytime the four of us who had seen and
heard, shrank from the gallery, and made any conceivable
excuse for avoiding it.</p>

<p>But Phil, however convinced, behaved consistently.
He examined the closed door thoroughly,
to detect any possible trickery. He explored the
attics, he went up and down the staircase leading
to the offices, till the servants must have thought
he was going crazy. He found <i>nothing</i>&mdash;no vaguest
hint even as to why the gallery was chosen by the
ghostly shadow for its nightly round.</p>

<p>Strange to say, however, as the moon waned, our
horror faded, so that we almost began to hope the
thing was at an end, and to trust that in time we
should forget about it. And we congratulated ourselves
that we had kept our own counsel and not
disturbed any of the others&mdash;even father, who
would, no doubt, have hooted at the idea&mdash;by the
baleful whisper that our charming castle by the
sea was haunted!</p>

<p>And the days passed by, growing into weeks.
The second detachment of our guests had left, and
a third had just arrived, when one morning as I
was waiting at what we called "the sea-door" for
some of the others to join me in a walk along the
sands, some one touched me on the shoulder. It
was Philip.</p>

<p>"Leila," he said, "I am not happy about
Dormer. He is looking ill again, and<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"I thought he seemed so much stronger," I
said, surprised and distressed, "quite rosy, and so
much merrier."</p>

<p>"So he was till a few days ago," said Philip.
"But if you notice him well you'll see that he's
getting that white look again. And&mdash;I've got it
into my head&mdash;he is an extraordinarily sensitive
child, that it has something to do with the moon.
It's getting on to the full."</p>

<p>For the moment I stupidly forgot the association.</p>

<p>"Really, Phil," I said, "you are too absurd!
Do you actually&mdash;oh," as he was beginning to
interrupt me, and my face fell, I feel sure&mdash;"you
don't mean about the gallery."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he said.</p>

<p>"How? Has Dormy told you anything?"
and a sort of sick feeling came over me. "I had
begun to hope," I went on, "that somehow it had
gone; that, perhaps, it only comes once a year at
a certain season, or possibly that newcomers see it
at the first and not again. Oh, Phil, we <i>can't</i> stay
here, however nice it is, if it is really haunted."</p>

<p>"Dormy hasn't said much," Philip replied.
"He only told me he had <i>felt the cold</i> once or
twice, 'since the moon came again,' he said.
But I can see the fear of more is upon him.
And this determined me to speak to you. I have
to go to London for ten days or so, to see the
doctors about my leave, and a few other things.
I don't like it for you and Miss Larpent if&mdash;if
this thing is to return&mdash;with no one else in your
confidence, especially on Dormy's account. Do
you think we must tell father before I go?"</p>

<p>I hesitated. For many reasons I was reluctant
to do so. Father would be exaggeratedly sceptical
at first, and then, if he were convinced, as I <i>knew</i>
he would be, he would go to the other extreme and
insist upon leaving Finster, and there would be
a regular upset, trying for mother and everybody
concerned. And mother liked the place, and was
looking so much better!</p>

<p>"After all," I said, "it has not hurt any of us.
Miss Larpent got a shake, so did I. But it wasn't
as great a shock to us as to you, Phil, to have to
believe in a ghost. And we can avoid the gallery
while you are away. No, except for Dormy, I
would rather keep it to ourselves&mdash;after all, we
are not going to live here always. Yet it is so
nice, it seems such a pity."</p>

<p>It was such an exquisite morning; the air,
faintly breathing of the sea, was like elixir; the
heights and shadows on the cliffs, thrown out by
the darker woods behind, were indeed, as Janet
Miles had said, "wonderful".</p>

<p>"Yes," Phil agreed, "it is an awful nuisance.
But as for Dormy," he went on, "supposing I get
mother to let me take him with me? He'd be as
jolly as a sand-boy in London, and my old landlady
would look after him like anything if ever
I had to be out late. And I'd let my doctor see
him&mdash;quietly, you know&mdash;he might give him a
tonic or something."</p>

<p>I heartily approved of the idea. So did mamma
when Phil broached it&mdash;she, too, had thought her
"baby" looking quite pale lately. A London
doctor's opinion would be such a satisfaction. So
it was settled, and the very next day the two set
off. Dormer, in his "old-fashioned," reticent way,
in the greatest delight, though only by one remark
did the brave little fellow hint at what was, no
doubt, the principal cause of his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The moon will be long past the full when we
come back," he said. "And after that there'll only
be one other time before we go, won't there, Leila?
We've only got this house for three months?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "father only took it for three,"
though in my heart I knew it was with the option
of three more&mdash;six in all.</p>

<p>And Miss Larpent and I were left alone, not
with the ghost, certainly, but with our fateful
knowledge of its unwelcome proximity.</p>

<p>We did not speak of it to each other, but we
tacitly avoided the gallery, even, as much as
possible, in the daytime. I felt, and so, she has
since confessed, did she, that it would be impossible
to endure <i>that cold</i> without betraying ourselves.</p>

<p>And I began to breathe more freely, trusting that
the dread of the shadow's possible return was
really only due to the child's overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>Till&mdash;one morning&mdash;my fool's paradise was
abruptly destroyed.</p>

<p>Father came in late to breakfast&mdash;he had been
for an early walk, he said, to get rid of a headache.
But he did not look altogether as if he had
succeeded in doing so.</p>

<p>"Leila," he said, as I was leaving the room after
pouring out his coffee&mdash;mamma was not yet allowed
to get up early&mdash;"Leila, don't go. I want to
speak to you."</p>

<p>I stopped short, and turned towards the table.
There was something very odd about his manner.
He is usually hearty and eager, almost impetuous
in his way of speaking.</p>

<p>"Leila," he began again, "you are a sensible
girl, and your nerves are strong, I fancy. Besides,
you have not been ill like the others. Don't
speak of what I am going to tell you."</p>

<p>I nodded in assent; I could scarcely have spoken.
My heart was beginning to thump. Father would
not have commended my nerves had he known it.</p>

<p>"Something odd and inexplicable happened last
night," he went on. "Nugent and I were sitting
in the gallery. It was a mild night, and the moon
magnificent. We thought the gallery would be
pleasanter than the smoking-room, now that Phil
and his pipes are away. Well&mdash;we were sitting
quietly. I had lighted my reading-lamp on the
little table at one end of the room, and Nugent
was half lying in his chair, doing nothing in particular
except admiring the night, when all at once
he started violently with an exclamation, and,
jumping up, came towards me. Leila, his teeth
were chattering, and he was <i>blue</i> with cold. I was
very much alarmed&mdash;you know how ill he was at
college. But in a moment or two he recovered.</p>

<p>"'What on earth is the matter?' I said to him.
He tried to laugh.</p>

<p>"'I really don't know,' he said; 'I felt as if I
had had an electric shock of <i>cold</i>&mdash;but I'm all right
again now.'</p>

<p>"I went into the dining-room, and made him
take a little brandy and water, and sent him off to
bed. Then I came back, still feeling rather uneasy
about him, and sat down with my book, when, Leila&mdash;you
will scarcely credit it&mdash;I myself felt the same
shock exactly. A perfectly <i>hideous</i> thrill of cold.
That was how it began. I started up, and then,
Leila, by degrees, in some instinctive way, I seemed
to realise what had caused it. My dear child, you
will think I have gone crazy when I tell you that
there was a shadow&mdash;a shadow in the
moonlight&mdash;<i>chasing</i> me, so to say, round the room, and once
again it caught me up, and again came that
appalling sensation. I would not give in. I
dodged it after that, and set myself to watch it, and
then<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>I need not quote my father further; suffice to
say his experience matched that of the rest of us
entirely&mdash;no, I think it surpassed them. It was
the worst of all.</p>

<p>Poor father! I shuddered for him. I think a
shock of that kind is harder upon a man than upon
a woman. Our sex is less sceptical, less entrenched
in sturdy matters of fact, more imaginative, or
whatever you like to call the readiness to believe
what we cannot explain. And it was astounding
to me to see how my father at once capitulated&mdash;never
even <i>alluding</i> to a possibility of trickery.
Astounding, yet at the same time not without a
certain satisfaction in it. It was almost a relief to
find others in the same boat with ourselves.</p>

<p>I told him at once all <i>we</i> had to tell, and
how painfully exercised we had been as to the
advisability of keeping our secret to ourselves. I
never saw father so impressed; he was awfully
kind, too, and so sorry for us. He made me fetch
Miss Larpent, and we held a council of&mdash;I don't
know what to call it!&mdash;not "war," assuredly, for
none of us thought of fighting the ghost. How
could one fight a shadow?</p>

<p>We decided to do nothing beyond endeavouring
to keep the affair from going further. During
the next few days father arranged to have some
work done in the gallery which would prevent
our sitting there, without raising any suspicions
on mamma's or Sophy's part.</p>

<p>"And then," said father, "we must see.
Possibly this extraordinary influence only makes
itself felt periodically."</p>

<p>"I am almost certain it is so," said Miss
Larpent.</p>

<p>"And in this case," he continued, "we may
manage to evade it. But I do not feel disposed
to continue my tenancy here after three months
are over. If once the servants get hold of the
story, and they are sure to do so sooner or later,
it would be unendurable&mdash;the worry and annoyance
would do your mother far more harm than
any good effect the air and change have had
upon her."</p>

<p>I was glad to hear this decision. Honestly, I
did not feel as if I could stand the strain for
long, and it might kill poor little Dormy.</p>

<p>But where should we go? Our own home
would be quite uninhabitable till the autumn,
for extensive alterations and repairs were going
on there. I said this to father.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "it is not convenient,"&mdash;and
he hesitated. "I cannot make it out," he
went on, "Miles would have been <i>sure</i> to know
if the house had a bad name in any way. I think
I will go over and see him to-day, and tell him
all about it&mdash;at least I shall inquire about some
other house in the neighbourhood&mdash;and <i>perhaps</i>
I will tell him our reason for leaving this."</p>

<p>He did so&mdash;he went over to Raxtrew that very
afternoon, and, as I quite anticipated would be
the case, he told me on his return that he had
taken both our friends into his confidence.</p>

<p>"They are extremely concerned about it," he
said, "and very sympathising, though, naturally,
inclined to think us a parcel of very weak-minded
folk indeed. But I am glad of one thing&mdash;the
Rectory there, is to be let from the first of July
for three months. Miles took me to see it. I
think it will do very well&mdash;it is quite out of the
village, for you really can't call it a town&mdash;and a
nice little place in its way. Quite modern, and
as unghost-like as you could wish, bright and
cheery."</p>

<p>"And what will mamma think of our leaving
so soon?" I asked.</p>

<p>But as to this father reassured me. He had
already spoken of it to her, and somehow she did
not seem disappointed. She had got it into her
head that Finster did not suit Dormy, and was
quite disposed to think that three months of such
strong air were enough at a time.</p>

<p>"Then have you decided upon Raxtrew Rectory?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I have the refusal of it," said my father.
"But you will be almost amused to hear that
Miles begged me not to fix absolutely for a few
days. He is coming to us to-morrow, to spend
the night."</p>

<p>"You mean to see for himself?"</p>

<p>Father nodded.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Miles!" I ejaculated. "You won't
sit up with him, I hope, father?"</p>

<p>"I offered to do so, but he won't hear of it,"
was the reply. "He is bringing one of his keepers
with him&mdash;a sturdy, trustworthy young fellow,
and they two with their revolvers are going to nab
the ghost, so he says. We shall see. We must
manage to prevent our servants suspecting anything."</p>

<p>This <i>was</i> managed. I need not go into particulars.
Suffice to say that the sturdy keeper
reached his own home before dawn on the night of
the vigil, no endeavours of his master having
succeeded in persuading him to stay another
moment at Finster, and that Mr. Miles himself
looked so ill the next morning when he joined us
at the breakfast-table that we, the initiated, could
scarcely repress our exclamations, when Sophy,
with the curious instinct of touching a sore place
which some people have, told him that he looked
exactly "as if he had seen a ghost".</p>

<p>His experience had been precisely similar to
ours. After that we heard no more from him&mdash;about
the pity it was to leave a place that suited us
so well, etc., etc. On the contrary, before he left,
he told my father and myself that he thought us
uncommonly plucky for staying out the three
months, though at the same time he confessed to
feeling completely nonplussed.</p>

<p>"I have lived near Finster St. Mabyn's all my
life," he said, "and my people before me, and
<i>never</i>, do I honestly assure you, have I heard one
breath of the old place being haunted. And in a
shut-up neighbourhood like this, such a thing
would have leaked out."</p>

<p>We shook our heads, but what could we say?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>PART III.</h4>

<p>We left Finster St. Mabyn's towards the middle
of July.</p>

<p>Nothing worth recording happened during the
last few weeks. If the ghostly drama were still
re-enacted night after night, or only during some
portion of each month, we took care not to assist
at the performance. I believe Phil and Nugent
planned another vigil, but gave it up by my father's
expressed wish, and on one pretext or another he
managed to keep the gallery locked off without
arousing any suspicion in my mother or Sophy, or
any of our visitors.</p>

<p>It was a cold summer,&mdash;those early months of
it at least&mdash;and that made it easier to avoid the
room.</p>

<p>Somehow none of us were sorry to go. This
was natural, so far as several were concerned, but
rather curious as regarded those of the family who
knew no drawback to the charms of the place. I
suppose it was due to some instinctive consciousness
of the influence which so many of the party
had felt it impossible to resist or explain.</p>

<p>And the Rectory at Raxtrew was really a dear
little place. It was so bright and open and sunny.
Dormy's pale face was rosy with pleasure the first
afternoon when he came rushing in to tell us that
there were tame rabbits and a pair of guinea-pigs
in an otherwise empty loose box in the stable-yard.</p>

<p>"Do come and look at them," he begged, and
I went with him, pleased to see him so happy.</p>

<p>I did not care for the rabbits, but I always think
guinea-pigs rather fascinating, and we stayed playing
with them some little time.</p>

<p>"I'll show you another way back into the house,"
said Dormy, and he led me through a conservatory
into a large, almost unfurnished room, opening
again into a tiled passage leading to the offices.</p>

<p>"This is the Warden boys' playroom," he said.
"They keep their cricket and football things here,
you see, and their tricycle. I wonder if I might
use it?"</p>

<p>"We must write and ask them," I said. "But
what are all these big packages?" I went on.
"Oh, I see, its our heavy luggage from Finster.
There is not room in this house for our odds and
ends of furniture, I suppose. It's rather a pity
they have put it in here, for we could have had
some nice games in this big room on a wet
day, and see, Dormy, here are several pairs of
roller skates! Oh, we must have this place
cleared."</p>

<p>We spoke to father about it&mdash;he came and looked
at the room and agreed with us that it would be a
pity not to have the full use of it. Roller skating
would be good exercise for Dormy, he said, and
even for Nat, who would be joining us before long
for his holidays.</p>

<p>So our big cases, and the chairs and tables we
had bought from Hunter, in their careful swathings
of wisps and matting, were carried out to an
empty barn&mdash;a perfectly dry and weather-tight
barn&mdash;for everything at the Rectory was in
excellent repair. In this, as in all other details,
our new quarters were a complete contrast to the
picturesque abode we had just quitted.</p>

<p>The weather was charming for the first two or
three weeks&mdash;much warmer and sunnier than at
Finster. We all enjoyed it, and seemed to breathe
more freely. Miss Larpent, who was staying
through the holidays this year, and I congratulated
each other more than once, when sure of not being
overheard, on the cheerful, wholesome atmosphere
in which we found ourselves.</p>

<p>"I do not think I shall ever wish to live in a
very old house again," she said one day. We were
in the play-room, and I had been persuading her to
try her hand&mdash;or feet&mdash;at roller skating. "Even
now," she went on, "I own to you, Leila, though
it may sound very weak-minded, I cannot think of
that horrible night without a shiver. Indeed,
I could fancy I feel that thrill of indescribable
cold at the present moment."</p>

<p>She <i>was</i> shivering&mdash;and, extraordinary to relate,
as she spoke, her tremor communicated itself to
me. Again, I could swear to it, again I felt that
blast of unutterable, unearthly cold.</p>

<p>I started up. We were seated on a bench against
the wall&mdash;a bench belonging to the play-room, and
which we had not thought of removing, as a few
seats were a convenience.</p>

<p>Miss Larpent caught sight of my face. Her
own, which was very white, grew distressed in expression.
She grasped my arm.</p>

<p>"My dearest child," she exclaimed, "you look
blue, and your teeth are chattering! I do wish I
had not alluded to that fright we had. I had no
idea you were so nervous."</p>

<p>"I did not know it myself," I replied. "I often
think of the Finster ghost quite calmly, even in
the middle of the night. But just then, Miss
Larpent, do you know, I really <i>felt</i> that horrid
cold again!"</p>

<p>"So did I&mdash;or rather my imagination did," she
replied, trying to talk in a matter-of-fact way.
She got up as she spoke, and went to the window.
"It can't be <i>all</i> imagination," she added. "See,
Leila, what a gusty, stormy day it is&mdash;not like the
beginning of August. It really is cold."</p>

<p>"And this play-room seems nearly as draughty
as the gallery at Finster," I said. "Don't let us
stay here&mdash;come into the drawing-room and play
some duets. I wish we could quite forget about
Finster."</p>

<p>"Dormy has done so, I hope," said Miss
Larpent.</p>

<p>That chilly morning was the commencement
of the real break-up in the weather. We women
would not have minded it so much, as there are
always plenty of indoor things we can find to do.
And my two grown-up brothers were away.
Raxtrew held no particular attractions for them,
and Phil wanted to see some of our numerous
relations before he returned to India. So he and
Nugent started on a round of visits. But, unluckily,
it was the beginning of the public school
holidays, and poor Nat&mdash;the fifteen-year-old boy&mdash;had
just joined us. It was very disappointing
for him in more ways than one. He had set
his heart on seeing Finster, impressed by our
enthusiastic description of it when we first went
there, and now his anticipations had to come
down to a comparatively tame and uninteresting
village, and every probability&mdash;so said the wise&mdash;of
a stretch of rainy, unsummerlike weather.</p>

<p>Nat is a good-natured, cheery fellow, however&mdash;not
nearly as clever or as impressionable as
Dormy, but with the same common sense. So
he wisely determined to make the best of things,
and as we were really sorry for him, he did not,
after all, come off very badly.</p>

<p>His principal amusement was roller-skating in
the play-room. Dormy had not taken to it in
the same way&mdash;the greater part of <i>his</i> time was
spent with the rabbits and guinea-pigs, where
Nat, when he himself had had skating enough,
was pretty sure to find him.</p>

<p>I suppose it is with being the eldest sister that
it always seems my fate to receive the confidences
of the rest of the family, and it was about this
time, a fortnight or so after his arrival, that it
began to strike me that Nat looked as if he had
something on his mind.</p>

<p>"He is sure to tell me what it is, sooner or
later," I said to myself. "Probably he has left
some small debts behind him at school&mdash;only he
did not look worried or anxious when he first
came home."</p>

<p>The confidence was given. One afternoon Nat
followed me into the library, where I was going
to write some letters, and said he wanted to speak
to me. I put my paper aside and waited.</p>

<p>"Leila," he began, "you must promise not to
laugh at me."</p>

<p>This was not what I expected.</p>

<p>"Laugh at you&mdash;no, certainly not," I replied,
"especially if you are in any trouble. And
I have thought you were looking worried,
Nat."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," he said, "I don't know if there
is anything coming over me&mdash;I feel quite well,
but&mdash;Leila," he broke off, "do you believe in
ghosts?"</p>

<p>I started.</p>

<p>"Has any one<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" I was beginning rashly,
but the boy interrupted me.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said eagerly, "no one has put
anything of the kind into my head&mdash;no one. It
is my own senses that have seen&mdash;felt it&mdash;or else,
if it is fancy, I must be going out of my mind,
Leila&mdash;I do believe there is a ghost here <i>in the
play-room</i>."</p>

<p>I sat silent, an awful dread creeping over me,
which, as he went on, grew worse and worse. Had
the thing&mdash;the Finster shadow&mdash;attached itself to
us&mdash;I had read of such cases&mdash;had it journeyed
with us to this peaceful, healthful house? The
remembrance of the cold thrill experienced by
Miss Larpent and myself flashed back upon me.
And Nat went on.</p>

<p>Yes, the cold was the first thing he had been
startled by, followed, just as in the gallery of our
old castle, by the consciousness of the terrible
shadow-like presence, gradually taking form in the
moonlight. For there had been moonlight the
last night or two, and Nat, in his skating ardour,
had amused himself alone in the play-room after
Dormy had gone to bed.</p>

<p>"The night before last was the worst," he said.
"It stopped raining, you remember, Leila, and the
moon was very bright&mdash;I noticed how it glistened
on the wet leaves outside. It was by the moonlight
I saw the&mdash;the shadow. I wouldn't have thought
of skating in the evening but for the light, for
we've never had a lamp in there. It came round
the walls, Leila, and then it seemed to stop and
fumble away in one corner&mdash;at the end where there
is a bench, you know."</p>

<p>Indeed I did know; it was where our governess
and I had been sitting.</p>

<p>"I got so awfully frightened," said Nat honestly,
"that I ran off. Then yesterday I was ashamed
of myself, and went back there in the evening
with a candle. But I saw nothing: the moon did
not come out. Only&mdash;I felt the cold again. I
believe it was there&mdash;though I could not see it.
Leila, what <i>can</i> it be? If only I could make you
understand! It is so <i>much</i> worse than it sounds to
tell."</p>

<p>I said what I could to soothe him. I spoke of
odd shadows thrown by the trees outside swaying
in the wind, for the weather was still stormy. I
repeated the time-worn argument about optical
illusions, etc., etc., and in the end he gave in a
little. It <i>might</i> have been his fancy. And he
promised me most faithfully to breathe no hint&mdash;not
the very faintest&mdash;of the fright he had had,
to Sophy or Dormy, or any one.</p>

<p>Then I had to tell my father. I really shrank
from doing so, but there seemed no alternative.
At first, of course, he pooh-poohed it at once by
saying Dormy must have been talking to Nat
about the Finster business, or if not Dormy, <i>some
one</i>&mdash;Miss Larpent even! But when all such
explanations were entirely set at nought, I must
say poor father looked rather blank. I was sorry
for him, and sorry for myself&mdash;the idea of being
<i>followed</i> by this horrible presence was too
sickening.</p>

<p>Father took refuge at last in some brain-wave
theory&mdash;involuntary impressions had been made on
Nat by all of us, whose minds were still full of the
strange experience. He said he felt sure, and no
doubt he tried to think he did, that this theory
explained the whole. I felt glad for him to get
any satisfaction out of it, and I did my best to
take it up too. But it was no use. I felt that
Nat's experience had been an "objective" one,
as Miss Larpent expressed it&mdash;or, as Dormy
had said at the first at Finster: "No, no,
sister&mdash;it's something <i>there</i>&mdash;it's nothing to do
with <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>And earnestly I longed for the time to come for
our return to our own familiar home.</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall ever wish to leave it
again," I thought.</p>

<p>But after a week or two the feeling began to
fade again. And father very sensibly discovered
that it would not do to leave our spare furniture
and heavy luggage in the barn&mdash;it was getting all
dusty and cobwebby. So it was all moved back
again to the play-room, and stacked as it had
been at first, making it impossible for us to skate
or amuse ourselves in any way there, at which
Sophy grumbled, but Nat did not.</p>

<p>Father was very good to Nat. He took him
about with him as much as he could to get the
thought of that horrid thing out of his head. But
yet it could not have been half as bad for Nat as
for the rest of us, for we took the greatest possible
precautions against any whisper of the dreadful
and mysterious truth reaching him, that the ghost
had <i>followed us</i> from Finster.</p>

<p>Father did not tell Mr. Miles or Jenny about it.
They had been worried enough, poor things, by
the trouble at Finster, and it would be too bad for
them to think that the strange influence was
affecting us in the <i>second</i> house we had taken at
their recommendation.</p>

<p>"In fact," said father with a rather rueful smile,
"if we don't take care, we shall begin to be looked
upon askance as a haunted family! Our lives
would have been in danger in the good old witchcraft
days."</p>

<p>"It is really a mercy that none of the servants
have got hold of the story," said Miss Larpent,
who was one of our council of three. "We must
just hope that no further annoyance will befall us
till we are safe at home again."</p>

<p>Her hopes were fulfilled. Nothing else happened
while we remained at the Rectory&mdash;it really seemed
as if the unhappy shade was limited locally, in one
sense. For at Finster, even, it had never been
seen or felt save in the one room.</p>

<p>The vividness of the impression of poor Nat's
experience had almost died away when the time
came for us to leave. I felt now that I should
rather enjoy telling Phil and Nugent about it,
and hearing what <i>they</i> could bring forward in
the way of explanation.</p>

<p>We left Raxtrew early in October. Our two
big brothers were awaiting us at home, having
arrived there a few days before us. Nugent was
due at Oxford very shortly.</p>

<p>It was very nice to be in our own house again,
after several months' absence, and it was most
interesting to see how the alterations, including
a good deal of new papering and painting, had
been carried out. And as soon as the heavy
luggage arrived we had grand consultations as
to the disposal about the rooms of the charming
pieces of furniture we had picked up at Hunter's.
Our rooms are large and nicely shaped, most of
them. It was not difficult to make a pretty
corner here and there with a quaint old chair or
two and a delicate spindle-legged table, and when
we had arranged them all&mdash;Phil, Nugent, and I,
were the movers&mdash;we summoned mother and
Miss Larpent to give their opinion.</p>

<p>They quite approved, mother even saying that
she would be glad of a few more odds and ends.</p>

<p>"We might empower Janet Miles," she said,
"to let us know if she sees anything very
tempting. Is that really all we have? They
looked so much more important in their
swathings."</p>

<p>The same idea struck me. I glanced round.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "that's all, except&mdash;oh, yes,
there are the tapestry "<i>porti&egrave;res</i>"&mdash;the best of all.
We can't have them in the drawing-room, I
fear. It is too modern for them. Where shall
we hang them?"</p>

<p>"You are forgetting, Leila," said mother.
"We spoke of having them in the hall. They
will do beautifully to hang before the two side
doors, which are seldom opened. And in cold
weather the hall is draughty, though nothing like
the gallery at Finster."</p>

<p>Why did she say that? It made me shiver,
but then, of course, she did not know.</p>

<p>Our hall is a very pleasant one. We sit there
a great deal. The side doors mother spoke of
are second entrances to the dining-room and
library&mdash;quite unnecessary, except when we have
a large party, a dance or something of that sort.
And the "<i>porti&egrave;res</i>" certainly seemed the very thing,
the mellow colouring of the tapestry showing to
great advantage. The boys&mdash;Phil and Nugent,
I mean&mdash;set to work at once, and in an hour or
two the hangings were placed.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Philip, "if ever these doors
are to be opened, this precious tapestry must be
taken down, or very carefully looped back. It is
very worn in some places, and in spite of the
thick lining it should be tenderly handled. I am
afraid it has suffered a little from being so long
rolled up at the Rectory. It should have been
hung up!"</p>

<p>Still, it looked very well indeed, and when
father, who was away at some magistrates' meeting,
came home that afternoon, I showed him our
arrangements with pride.</p>

<p>He was very pleased.</p>

<p>"Very nice&mdash;very nice indeed," he said, though
it was almost too dusk for him to judge quite fully
of the effect of the tapestry. "But, dear me, child,
this hall is very cold. We must have a larger fire.
Only October! What sort of a winter are we
going to have?"</p>

<p>He shivered as he spoke. He was standing close
to one of the "<i>porti&egrave;res</i>"&mdash;smoothing the tapestry
half absently with one hand. I looked at him with
concern.</p>

<p>"I <i>hope</i> you have not got a chill, papa," I
said.</p>

<p>But he seemed all right again when we went into
the library, where tea was waiting&mdash;an extra late
tea for his benefit.</p>

<p>The next day Nugent went to Oxford. Nat had
already returned to school. So our home party
was reduced to father and mother, Miss Larpent,
Phil and I, and the children.</p>

<p>We were very glad to have Phil settled at home
for some time. There was little fear of his being
tempted away, now that the shooting had begun.
We were expecting some of our usual guests at
this season; the weather was perfect autumn
weather; we had thrown off all remembrance of
influenza and other depressing "influences," and
were feeling bright and cheerful, when again&mdash;ah,
yes, even now it gives me a faint, sick sensation to
recall the horror of that <i>third</i> visitation!</p>

<p>But I must tell it simply, and not give way to
painful remembrances.</p>

<p>It was the very day before our first visitors were
expected that the blow fell, the awful fear made
itself felt. And, as before, the victim was a new
one&mdash;the one who, for reasons already mentioned,
we had specially guarded from any breath of the
gruesome terror&mdash;poor little Sophy!</p>

<p>What she was doing alone in the hall late that
evening I cannot quite recall&mdash;yes, I think I
remember her saying she had run downstairs
when half-way up to bed, to fetch a book she had
left there in the afternoon. She had no light, and
the one lamp in the hall&mdash;we never sat there after
dinner&mdash;was burning feebly. <i>It was bright moonlight.</i></p>

<p>I was sitting at the piano, where I had been
playing in a rather sleepy way&mdash;when a sudden
touch on my shoulder made me start, and, looking
up, I saw my sister standing beside me, white and
trembling.</p>

<p>"Leila," she whispered, "come with me quickly.
I don't want mamma to notice."</p>

<p>For mother was still nervous and delicate.</p>

<p>The drawing-room is very long, and has two or
three doors. No-one else was at our end. It was
easy to make our way out unperceived. Sophy
caught my hand and hurried me upstairs without
speaking till we reached my own room, where a
bright fire was burning cheerfully.</p>

<p>Then she began.</p>

<p>"Leila," she said, "I have had such an awful
fright. I did not want to speak until we were safe
up here."</p>

<p>"What was it?" I exclaimed breathlessly.
Did I already suspect the truth? I really do
not know, but my nerves were not what they had
been.</p>

<p>Sophy gasped and began to tremble. I put my
arm round her.</p>

<p>"It does not sound so bad," she said. "But&mdash;oh,
Leila, what <i>could</i> it be? It was in the hall,"
and then I think she explained how she had come
to be there. "I was standing near the side door
into the library that we never use&mdash;and&mdash;all of a
sudden a sort of darkness came along the wall,
and seemed to settle on the door&mdash;where the old
tapestry is, you know. I thought it was the
shadow of something outside, for it was bright
moonlight, and the windows were not shuttered.
But in a moment I saw it could not be that&mdash;there
is nothing to throw such a shadow. It seemed to
wriggle about&mdash;like&mdash;like a monstrous spider,
or&mdash;" and there she hesitated&mdash;"almost like a
deformed sort of human being. And all at once,
Leila, my breath went and I fell down. I really
did. I was <i>choked</i> with cold. I think my senses
went away, but I am not sure. The next thing
I remember was rushing across the hall and then
down the south corridor to the drawing-room, and
then I was so thankful to see you there by the
piano."</p>

<p>I drew her down on my knee, poor child.</p>

<p>"It was very good of you, dear," I said, "to
control yourself, and not startle mamma."</p>

<p>This pleased her, but her terror was still uppermost.</p>

<p>"Leila," she said piteously, "can't you explain
it? I did so hope you could."</p>

<p>What <i>could</i> I say?</p>

<p>"I&mdash;one would need to go to the hall and look
well about to see what could cast such a shadow,"
I said vaguely, and I suppose I must involuntarily
have moved a little, for Sophy started, and clutched
me fast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Leila, don't go&mdash;you don't mean you are
going now?" she entreated.</p>

<p>Nothing truly was farther from my thoughts,
but I took care not to say so.</p>

<p>"I won't leave you if you'd rather not," I said,
"and I tell you what, Sophy, if you would like
very much to sleep here with me to-night, you
shall. I will ring and tell Freake to bring your
things down and undress you&mdash;on one condition."</p>

<p>"What?" she said eagerly. She was much impressed
by my amiability.</p>

<p>"That you won't say <i>one word</i> about this, or
give the least shadow of a hint to any one that
you have had a fright. You don't know the
trouble it will cause."</p>

<p>"Of course I will promise to let no one know,
if you think it better, for you are so kind to me,"
said Sophy. But there was a touch of reluctance
in her tone. "You&mdash;you mean to do something
about it though, Leila," she went on. "I shall
never be able to forget it if you don't."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I shall speak to father and Phil
about it to-morrow. If any one has been trying to
frighten us," I added unguardedly, "by playing
tricks, they certainly must be exposed."</p>

<p>"Not <i>us</i>," she corrected, "it was only me," and
I did not reply. Why I spoke of the possibility
of a trick I scarcely know. I had no hope of any
such explanation.</p>

<p>But another strange, almost incredible idea was
beginning to take shape in my mind, and with it
came a faint, very faint touch of relief. Could it
be not the <i>houses</i>, nor the <i>rooms</i>, nor, worst of all,
we ourselves that were haunted, but something or
things among the old furniture we had bought
at Raxtrew?</p>

<p>And lying sleepless that night a sudden flash of
illumination struck me&mdash;could it&mdash;whatever the
"it" was&mdash;could it have something to do with the
tapestry hangings?</p>

<p>The more I thought it over the more striking
grew the coincidences. At Finster it had been on
one of the closed doors that the shadow seemed to
settle, as again here in our own hall. But in both
cases the "<i>porti&egrave;res</i>" had hung in front!</p>

<p>And at the Rectory? The tapestry, as Philip
had remarked, had been there rolled up all the
time. Was it possible that it had never been taken
out to the barn at all? What <i>more</i> probable than
that it should have been left, forgotten, under the
bench where Miss Larpent and I had felt for the
second time that hideous cold? And, stay, something
else was returning to my mind in connection
with that bench. Yes&mdash;I had it&mdash;Nat had said
"it seemed to stop and fumble away in one
corner&mdash;at the end where there is a bench, you
know."</p>

<p>And then to my unutterable thankfulness at last
I fell asleep.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>PART IV.</h4>

<p>I told Philip the next morning. There was no
need to bespeak his attention. I think he felt
nearly as horrified as I had done myself at the
idea that our own hitherto bright, cheerful home
was to be haunted by this awful thing&mdash;influence
or presence, call it what you will. And the suggestions
which I went on to make struck him,
too, with a sense of relief.</p>

<p>He sat in silence for some time after making me
recapitulate as precisely as possible every detail of
Sophy's story.</p>

<p>"You are sure it was the door into the library?"
he said at last.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," I replied; "and, oh, Philip," I
went on, "it has just occurred to me that <i>father</i>
felt a chill there the other evening."</p>

<p>For till that moment the little incident in question
had escaped my memory.</p>

<p>"Do you remember which of the "<i>porti&egrave;res</i>"
hung in front of the door at Finster?" said Philip.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Dormy would," I said, "he used to examine
the pictures in the tapestry with great interest. I
should not know one from the other. There is an
old castle in the distance in each, and a lot of trees,
and something meant for a lake."</p>

<p>But in his turn Philip shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I won't speak to Dormy about
it if I can possibly help it. Leave it to me, Leila,
and try to put it out of your own mind as much as
you possibly can, and don't be surprised at anything
you may notice in the next few days. I will
tell you, first of any one, whenever I have anything
to tell."</p>

<p>That was all I could get out of him. So I took
his advice.</p>

<p>Luckily, as it turned out, Mr. Miles, the only
outsider, so to say (except the unfortunate keeper),
who had witnessed the ghostly drama, was one of
the shooting party expected that day. And him
Philip at once determined to consult about this
new and utterly unexpected manifestation.</p>

<p>He did not tell me this. Indeed, it was not till
fully a week later that I heard anything, and then
in a letter&mdash;a very long letter from my brother,
which, I think, will relate the sequel of our strange
ghost story better than any narration at second-hand,
of my own.</p>

<p>Mr. Miles only stayed two nights with us. The
very day after he came he announced that, to his
great regret, he was obliged&mdash;most unexpectedly&mdash;to
return to Raxtrew on important business.</p>

<p>"And," he continued, "I am afraid you will all
feel much more vexed with me when I tell you I
am going to carry off Phil with me."</p>

<p>Father looked very blank indeed.</p>

<p>"Phil!" he exclaimed, "and how about our
shooting?"</p>

<p>"You can easily replace us," said my brother,
"I have thought of that," and he added something
in a lower tone to father. He&mdash;Phil&mdash;was leaving
the room at the time. <i>I</i> thought it had reference
to the real reason of his accompanying Mr. Miles,
but I was mistaken. Father, however, said nothing
more in opposition to the plan, and the next morning
the two went off.</p>

<p>We happened to be standing at the hall door&mdash;several
of us&mdash;for we were a large party now&mdash;when
Phil and his friend drove away. As we
turned to re-enter the house, I felt some one touch
me. It was Sophy. She was going out for a constitutional
with Miss Larpent, but had stopped a
moment to speak to me.</p>

<p>"Leila," she said in a whisper, "why have they&mdash;did
you know that the tapestry had been taken
down?"</p>

<p>She glanced at me with a peculiar expression. I
had not observed it. Now, looking up, I saw that
the two locked doors were visible in the dark
polish of their old mahogany as of yore&mdash;no longer
shrouded by the ancient <i>porti&egrave;res</i>. I started in
surprise.</p>

<p>"No," I whispered in return, "I did not know.
Never mind, Sophy. I suspect there is a reason
for it which we shall know in good time."</p>

<p>I felt strongly tempted&mdash;the moon being still at
the full&mdash;to visit the hall that night&mdash;in hopes of
feeling and seeing&mdash;<i>nothing</i>. But when the time
drew near, my courage failed; besides I had
tacitly promised Philip to think as little as I
possibly could about the matter, and any vigil of
the kind would certainly not have been acting in
accordance with the spirit of his advice.</p>

<p>I think I will now copy, as it stands, the letter
from Philip which I received a week or so later.
It was dated from his club in London.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smallcaps">My dear Leila</span>,</p>

<p><span class="ind2">&nbsp;</span>"I have a long story to tell you and
a very extraordinary one. I think it is well that
it should be put into writing, so I will devote this
evening to the task&mdash;especially as I shall not be
home for ten days or so.</p>

<p>"You may have suspected that I took Miles into
my confidence as soon as he arrived. If you did
you were right. He was the best person to
speak to for several reasons. He looked, I must
say, rather&mdash;well 'blank' scarcely expresses it&mdash;when
I told him of the ghost's re-appearance,
not only at the Rectory, but in our own house,
and on both occasions to persons&mdash;Nat, and then
Sophy&mdash;who had not heard a breath of the story.
But when I went on to propound your suggestion,
Miles cheered up. He had been, I fancy, a trifle
touchy about our calling Finster haunted, and it
was evidently a satisfaction to him to start another
theory. We talked it well over, and we decided
to test the thing again&mdash;it took some resolution,
I own, to do so. We sat up that night&mdash;bright
moonlight luckily&mdash;and&mdash;well, I needn't repeat it
all. Sophy was quite correct. It came again&mdash;the
horrid creeping shadow&mdash;poor wretch, I'm
rather sorry for it now&mdash;just in the old way&mdash;quite
as much at home in <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>shire, apparently,
as in the Castle. It stopped at the closed library
door, and fumbled away, then started off again&mdash;ugh!
We watched it closely, but kept well in
the middle of the room, so that the cold did not
strike us so badly. We both noted the special
part of the tapestry where its hands seemed to
sprawl, and we meant to stay for another round;
but&mdash;when it came to the point we funked it, and
went to bed.</p>

<p>"Next morning, on pretence of examining the
date of the tapestry, we had it down&mdash;you were
all out&mdash;and we found&mdash;<i>something</i>. Just where
the hands felt about, there had been a cut&mdash;three
cuts, three sides of a square, as it were, making a
sort of door in the stuff, the fourth side having
evidently acted as a hinge, for there was a mark
where it had been folded back. And just where&mdash;treating
the thing as a door&mdash;you might expect
to find a handle to open it by, we found a distinct
dint in the tapestry, as if a button or knob had
once been there. We looked at each other. The
same idea had struck us. The tapestry had been
used to conceal a small door in the wall&mdash;the door
of a secret cupboard probably. The ghostly fingers
had been vainly seeking for the spring which in
the days of their flesh and bone they had been
accustomed to press.</p>

<p>"'The first thing to do,' said Miles, 'is to look
up Hunter and make him tell where he got the
tapestry from. Then we shall see.'</p>

<p>"'Shall we take the <i>porti&egrave;res</i> with us?' I said.</p>

<p>"But Miles shuddered, though he half laughed
too.</p>

<p>"'No, thank you,' he said. 'I'm not going to
travel with the evil thing.'</p>

<p>"'We can't hang it up again, though,' I said,
'after this last experience.'</p>

<p>"In the end we rolled up the two <i>porti&egrave;res</i>, not to
attract attention by only moving one, and&mdash;well,
I thought it just possible the ghost might make a
mistake, and I did not want any more scares while
I was away&mdash;we rolled them up together, first
carefully measuring the cut, and its position in the
curtain, and then we hid them away in one of the
lofts that no one ever enters, where they are at
this moment, and where the ghost may have been
disporting himself, for all I know, though I fancy
he has given it up by this time, for reasons you
shall hear.</p>

<p>"Then Miles and I, as you know, set off for Raxtrew.
I smoothed my father down about it, by
reminding him how good-natured they had been to
us, and telling him Miles really needed me. We
went straight to Hunter. He hummed and hawed
a good deal&mdash;he had not distinctly promised not to
give the name of the place the tapestry had come
from, but he knew the gentleman he had bought it
from did not want it known.</p>

<p>"'Why?' said Miles. 'Is it some family that
has come down in the world, and is forced to part
with things to get some ready money?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear no!' said Hunter. 'It is not that, at
all. It was only that&mdash;I suppose I must give you
the name&mdash;Captain Devereux&mdash;did not want any
gossip to get about, as to <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>'</p>

<p>"'Devereux!' repeated Miles, 'you don't mean
the people at Hallinger?'</p>

<p>"'The same,' said Hunter. 'If you know them,
sir, you will be careful, I hope, to assure the
captain that I did my best to carry out his
wishes?'</p>

<p>"'Certainly,' said Miles, 'I'll exonerate
you.'</p>

<p>"And then Hunter told us that Devereux, who
only came into the Hallinger property a few years
ago, had been much annoyed by stories getting
about of the place being haunted, and this had led
to his dismantling one wing, and&mdash;Hunter thought,
but was not quite clear as to this&mdash;pulling down
some rooms altogether. But he, Devereux, was
very touchy on the subject&mdash;he did not want to be
laughed at.</p>

<p>"'And the tapestry came from him&mdash;you are
certain as to that?' Miles repeated.</p>

<p>"'Positive, sir. I took it down with my own
hands. It was fitted on to two panels in what they
call the round room at Hallinger&mdash;there were, oh,
I daresay, a dozen of them, with tapestry nailed on,
but I only bought these two pieces&mdash;the others
were sold to a London dealer.'</p>

<p>"'The round room,' I said. Leila, the expression
struck me.</p>

<p>"Miles, it appeared, knew Devereux fairly well.
Hallinger is only ten miles off. We drove over
there, but found he was in London. So our next
move was to follow him there. We called twice at
his club, and then Miles made an appointment,
saying that he wanted to see him on private
business.</p>

<p>"He received us civilly, of course. He is quite
a young fellow&mdash;in the Guards. But when Miles
began to explain to him what we had come about,
he stiffened.</p>

<p>"'I suppose you belong to the Psychical Society?'
he said. 'I can only repeat that I have nothing
to tell, and I detest the whole subject.'</p>

<p>"'Wait a moment,' said Miles, and as he went
on I saw that Devereux changed. His face grew
intent with interest and a queer sort of eagerness,
and at last he started to his feet.</p>

<p>"'Upon my soul,' he said, 'I believe you've run
him to earth for me&mdash;the ghost, I mean, and if so,
you shall have my endless gratitude. I'll go down
to Hallinger with you at once&mdash;this afternoon, if
you like, and see it out.'</p>

<p>"He was so excited that he spoke almost incoherently,
but after a bit he calmed down, and told us
all he had to tell&mdash;and that was a good deal&mdash;which
would indeed have been nuts for the Psychical
Society. What Hunter had said was but a small
part of the whole. It appeared that on succeeding
to Hallinger, on the death of an uncle, young
Devereux had made considerable changes in the
house. He had, among others, opened out a small
wing&mdash;a sort of round tower&mdash;which had been
completely dismantled and bricked up for, I think
he said, over a hundred years. There was some
story about it. An ancestor of his&mdash;an awful
gambler&mdash;had used the principal room in this wing
for his orgies. Very queer things went on there,
the finish up being the finding of old Devereux dead
there one night, when his servants were summoned
by the man he had been playing with&mdash;with whom
he had had an awful quarrel. This man, a low
fellow, probably a professional cardsharper, vowed
that he had been robbed of a jewel which his host
had staked, and it was said that a ring of great
value had disappeared. But it was all hushed up&mdash;Devereux
had really died in a fit&mdash;though soon after,
for reasons only hinted at, the round tower was
shut up, till the present man rashly opened it
again.</p>

<p>"Almost at once, he said, the annoyances, to use a
mild term, began. First one, then another of the
household were terrified out of their wits, just as we
were, Leila. Devereux himself had seen it two or
three times, the 'it,' of course, being his miserable
old ancestor. A small man, with a big wig, and
long, thin, claw-like fingers. It all corresponded.
Mrs. Devereux is young and nervous. She could
not stand it. So in the end the round tower was
shut up again, all the furniture and hangings sold,
and locally speaking, the ghost laid. That was all
Devereux knew.</p>

<p>"We started, the three of us, that very afternoon,
as excited as a party of schoolboys. Miles and I
kept questioning Devereux, but he had really no
more to tell. He had never thought of examining
the walls of the haunted room&mdash;it was wainscotted,
he said&mdash;and might be lined all through with
secret cupboards, for all he knew. But he could
not get over the extraordinariness of the ghost's
sticking to the <i>tapestry</i>&mdash;and indeed it does rather
lower one's idea of ghostly intelligence.</p>

<p>"We went at it at once&mdash;the tower was not
<i>bricked</i> up again, luckily&mdash;we got in without
difficulty the next morning&mdash;Devereux making
some excuse to the servants, a new set who had
not heard of the ghost, for our eccentric proceedings.
It was a tiresome business. There were so
many panels in the room, as Hunter had said,
and it was impossible to tell in which <i>the</i> tapestry
had been fixed. But we had our measures, and
we carefully marked a line as near as we could
guess at the height from the floor that the cut
in the <i>porti&egrave;res</i> must have been. Then we tapped
and pummelled and pressed imaginary springs
till we were nearly sick of it&mdash;there was nothing
to guide us. The wainscotting was dark and
much shrunk and marked with age, and full of
joins in the wood any one of which might have
meant a door.</p>

<p>"It was Devereux himself who found it at last.
We heard an exclamation from where he was
standing by himself at the other side of the
room. He was quite white and shaky.</p>

<p>"'Look here,' he said, and we looked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;there was a small deep recess, or cupboard
in the thickness of the wall, excellently
contrived. Devereux had touched the spring at
last, and the door, just matching the cut in the
tapestry, flew open.</p>

<p>"Inside lay what at first we took for a packet
of letters, and I hoped to myself they contained
nothing that would bring trouble on poor Devereux.
They were not letters, however, but two
or three incomplete packs of cards&mdash;grey and
dust-thick with age&mdash;and as Miles spread them
out, certain markings on them told their own
tale. Devereux did not like it, naturally&mdash;their
supposed owner had been a member of his house.</p>

<p>"'The ghost has kept a conscience,' he said,
with an attempt at a laugh. 'Is there nothing
more?'</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a small leather bag&mdash;black and grimy,
though originally, I fancy, of chamois skin. It
drew with strings. Devereux pulled it open,
and felt inside.</p>

<p>"'By George!' he exclaimed. And he held
out the most magnificent diamond ring I have
ever seen&mdash;sparkling away as if it had only just
come from the polisher's. 'This must be <i>the</i>
ring,' he said.</p>

<p>"And we all stared&mdash;too astonished to speak.</p>

<p>"Devereux closed the cupboard again, after
carefully examining it to make sure nothing had been
left behind. He marked the exact spot where
he had pressed the spring so as to find it at any
time. Then we all left the round room, locking
the door securely after us.</p>

<p>"Miles and I spent that night at Hallinger. We
sat up late talking it all over. There are some
queer inconsistencies about the thing which will
probably never be explained. First and foremost&mdash;why
has the ghost stuck to the tapestry instead
of to the actual spot he seemed to have wished to
reveal? Secondly, what was the connection between
his visits and the full moon&mdash;or is it that only by
the moonlight the shade becomes perceptible to
human sense? Who can say?</p>

<p>"As to the story itself&mdash;what was old Devereux's
motive in concealing his own ring? Were the
marked cards his, or his opponent's, of which he
had managed to possess himself, and had secreted
as testimony against the other fellow?</p>

<p>"I incline, and so does Miles, to this last theory,
and when we suggested it to Devereux, I could see
it was a relief to him. After all, one likes to think
one's ancestors were gentlemen!</p>

<p>"'But what, then, has he been worrying about
all this century or more?' he said. 'If it were
that he wanted the ring returned to its real owner&mdash;supposing
the fellow <i>had</i> won it&mdash;I could understand
it, though such a thing would be impossible.
There is no record of the man at all&mdash;his name was
never mentioned in the story.'</p>

<p>"'He may want the ring restored to its proper
owner all the same,' said Miles. 'You are its
owner, as the head of the family, and it has been
your ancestor's fault that it has been hidden all
these years. Besides, we cannot take upon ourselves
to explain motives in such a case. Perhaps&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;the poor shade could not help
himself. His peregrinations may have been of the
nature of punishment.'</p>

<p>"'I hope they are over now,' said Devereux,
'for his sake and everybody else's. I should be
glad to think he wanted the ring restored to us,
but besides that, I should like to do something&mdash;something
<i>good</i> you know&mdash;if it would make him
easier, poor old chap. I must consult Lilias.'
Lilias is Mrs. Devereux.</p>

<p>"This is all I have to tell you at present, Leila.
When I come home we'll have the <i>porti&egrave;res</i> up
again and see what happens. I want you now to
read all this to my father, and if he has no objection&mdash;he
and my mother, of course&mdash;I should like
to invite Captain and Mrs. Devereux to stay a few
days with us&mdash;as well as Miles, as soon as I come
back."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Philip's wish was acceded to. It was with no
little anxiety and interest that we awaited his
return.</p>

<p>The tapestry <i>porti&egrave;res</i> were restored to their
place&mdash;and on the first moonlight night, my father,
Philip, Captain Devereux and Mr. Miles held their
vigil.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p><i>Nothing</i>&mdash;the peaceful rays lighted up the quaint
landscape of the tapestry, undisturbed by the poor
groping fingers&mdash;no gruesome unearthly chill as of
worse than death made itself felt to the midnight
watchers&mdash;the weary, may we not hope repentant,
spirit was at rest at last!</p>

<p>And never since has any one been troubled by
the shadow in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I cannot help hoping," said Mrs. Devereux,
when talking it over, "that what Michael has done
may have helped to calm the poor ghost."</p>

<p>And she told us what it was. Captain Devereux
is rich, though not immensely so. He had the
ring valued&mdash;it represented a very large sum, but
Philip says I had better not name the figures&mdash;and
then he, so to say, bought it from himself. And
with this money he&mdash;no, again, Phil says I must
not enter into particulars beyond saying that with
it he did something very good, and very useful,
which had long been a pet scheme of his wife's.</p>

<p>Sophy is grown up now and she knows the whole
story. So does our mother. And Dormy too has
heard it all. The horror of it has quite gone. We
feel rather proud of having been the actual witnesses
of a ghostly drama.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="st_II" id="st_II"></a>"THE MAN WITH THE COUGH."</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a German by birth and descent. My name
is Schmidt. But by education I am quite as much
an Englishman as a "Deutscher," and by affection
much more the former. My life has been spent
pretty equally between the two countries, and I
flatter myself I speak both languages without any
foreign accent.</p>

<p>I count England my headquarters now: it is
"home" to me. But a few years ago I was resident
in Germany, only going over to London now
and then on business. I will not mention the
town where I lived. It is unnecessary to do so,
and in the peculiar experience I am about to relate
I think real names of people and places are just as
well, or better, avoided.</p>

<p>I was connected with a large and important
firm of engineers. I had been bred up to the profession,
and was credited with a certain amount of
talent; and I was considered&mdash;and, with all
modesty, I think I deserved the opinion&mdash;steady
and reliable, so that I had already attained a fair
position in the house, and was looked upon as a
"rising man". But I was still young, and not
quite so wise as I thought myself. I came very
near once to making a great mess of a certain
affair. It is this story which I am going to tell.</p>

<p>Our house went in largely for patents&mdash;rather
too largely, some thought. But the head partner's
son was a bit of a genius in his way, and his father
was growing old, and let Herr Wilhelm&mdash;Moritz
we will call the family name&mdash;do pretty much as
he chose. And on the whole Herr Wilhelm did
well. He was cautious, and he had the benefit of
the still greater caution and larger experience of
Herr Gerhardt, the second partner in the firm.</p>

<p>Patents and the laws which regulate them are
queer things to have to do with. No one who has
not had personal experience of the complications
that arise could believe how far these spread and
how entangled they become. Great acuteness as
well as caution is called for if you would guide
your patent bark safely to port&mdash;and perhaps more
than anything, a power of holding your tongue.
I was no chatterbox, nor, when on a mission of
importance, did I go about looking as if I were bursting
with secrets, which is, in my opinion, almost as
dangerous as revealing them. No one, to meet me
on the journeys which it often fell to my lot to
undertake, would have guessed that I had anything
on my mind but an easy-going young fellow's natural
interest in his surroundings, though many a time I
have stayed awake through a whole night of railway
travel if at all doubtful about my fellow-passengers,
or not dared to go to sleep in a hotel without a
ready-loaded revolver by my pillow.</p>

<p>For now and then&mdash;though not through me&mdash;our
secrets did ooze out. And if, as <i>has</i> happened,
they were secrets connected with Government
orders or contracts, there was, or but for the
exertion of the greatest energy and tact on the part
of my superiors, there <i>would</i> have been, to put it
plainly, the devil to pay.</p>

<p>One morning&mdash;it was nearing the end of
November&mdash;I was sent for to Herr Wilhelm's
private room. There I found him and Herr
Gerhardt before a table spread with papers covered
with figures and calculations, and sheets of beautifully
executed diagrams.</p>

<p>"Lutz," said Herr Wilhelm. He had known
me from childhood, and often called me by the
abbreviation of my Christian name, which is
Ludwig, or Louis. "Lutz, we are going to confide
to you a matter of extreme importance. You
must be prepared to start for London to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," I said, "I shall be ready."</p>

<p>"You will take the express through to Calais&mdash;on
the whole it is the best route, especially at this
season. By travelling all night you will catch the
boat there, and arrive in London so as to have a
good night's rest, and be clear-headed for work
the next morning."</p>

<p>I bowed agreement, but ventured to make a
suggestion.</p>

<p>"If, as I infer, the matter is one of great importance,"
I said, "would it not be well for me to
start sooner? I can&mdash;yes," throwing a rapid
survey over the work I had before me for the next
two days&mdash;"I can be ready to-night."</p>

<p>Herr Wilhelm looked at Herr Gerhardt. Herr
Gerhardt shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "to-morrow it must be,"
and then he proceeded to explain to me why.</p>

<p>I need not attempt to give all the details of the
matter with which I was entrusted. Indeed, to
"lay" readers it would be impossible. Suffice it
to say, the whole concerned a patent&mdash;that of a
very remarkable and wonderful invention, which
it was hoped and believed the Governments of both
countries would take up. But to secure this being
done in a thoroughly satisfactory manner it was
necessary that our firm should go about it in concert
with an English house of first-rate standing. To
this house&mdash;the firm of Messrs. Bluestone and
Fagg I will call them&mdash;I was to be sent with full
explanations. And the next half-hour or more
passed in my superiors going minutely into the
details, so as to satisfy themselves that I understood.
The mastering of the whole was not difficult, for I
was well grounded technically; and like many of
the best things the idea was essentially simple, and
the diagrams were perfect. When the explanations
were over, and my instructions duly noted, I began
to gather together the various sheets, which were
all numbered. But, to my surprise, Herr Gerhardt,
looking over me, withdrew two of the most important
diagrams, without which the others were
valueless, because inexplicable.</p>

<p>"Stay," he said; "these two, Ludwig, must be
kept separate. These we send to-day, by registered
post, direct to Bluestone and Fagg. They will
receive them a day before they see you, and with
them a letter announcing your arrival."</p>

<p>I looked up in some disappointment. I had
known of precautions of the kind being taken, but
usually when the employ&eacute; sent was less reliable than
I believed myself to be. Still, I scarcely dared to
demur.</p>

<p>"Do you think that necessary?" I said respectfully.
"I can assure you that from the moment
you entrust me with the papers they shall never
quit me day or night. And if there were any
postal delay&mdash;you say time is valuable in this case&mdash;or
if the papers were stolen in the transit&mdash;such
things have happened&mdash;my whole mission would
be worthless."</p>

<p>"We do not doubt your zeal and discretion,
my good Schmidt," said Herr Gerhardt. "But
in this case we must take even extra precautions.
I had not meant to tell you, fearing to add to the
certain amount of nervousness and strain unavoidable
in such a case, but still, perhaps it is best that
you should know that we <i>have</i> reason for some
special anxiety. It has been hinted to us that some
breath of this"&mdash;and he tapped the papers&mdash;"has
reached those who are always on the watch for such
things. We cannot be too careful."</p>

<p>"And yet," I persisted, "you would trust the
post?"</p>

<p>"We do not trust the post," he replied. "Even
if these diagrams were tampered with, they would
be perfectly useless. And tampered with they
will not be. But even supposing anything so wild,
the rogues in question knowing of your departure
(and they are <i>more</i> likely to know of it than
of our packet by post), were they in collusion
with some traitor in the post-office, are sharp
enough to guess the truth&mdash;that we have made a
Masonic secret of it&mdash;the two separate diagrams
are valueless without your papers; <i>your</i> papers
reveal nothing without Nos. 7 and 13."</p>

<p>I bowed in submission. But I was, all the same,
disappointed, as I said, and a trifle mortified.</p>

<p>Herr Wilhelm saw it, and cheered me up.</p>

<p>"All right, Lutz, my boy," he said. "I feel
just like you&mdash;nothing I should enjoy more than
a rush over to London, carrying the whole documents,
and prepared for a fight with any one who
tried to get hold of them. But Herr Gerhardt
here is cooler-blooded than we are."</p>

<p>The elder man smiled.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt your readiness to fight, nor
Ludwig's either. But it would be by no such
honestly brutal means as open robbery that we
should be outwitted. Make friends readily with
no one while travelling, Lutz, yet avoid the appearance
of keeping yourself aloof. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I said. "I shall sleep well to-night,
so as to be prepared to keep awake throughout
the journey."</p>

<p>The papers were then carefully packed up.
Those consigned to my care were to be carried in
a certain light, black handbag with a very good
lock, which had often before been my travelling
companion.</p>

<p>And the following evening I started by the
express train agreed upon. So, at least, I have
always believed, but I have never been able to
bring forward a witness to the fact of my train at
the start being the right one, as no one came with
me to see me off. For it was thought best that I
should depart in as unobtrusive a manner as
possible, as, even in a large town such as ours, the
members and employ&eacute;s of an old and important
house like the Moritzes' were well known.</p>

<p>I took my ticket then, registering no luggage,
as I had none but what I easily carried in my
hand, as well as <i>the</i> bag. It was already dusk, if
not dark, and there was not much bustle in the
station, nor apparently many passengers. I took
my place in an empty second-class compartment,
and sat there quietly till the train should start. A
few minutes before it did so, another man got in.
I was somewhat annoyed at this, as in my circumstances
nothing was more undesirable than travelling
alone with one other. Had there been
a crowded compartment, or one with three or four
passengers, I would have chosen it; but at the
moment I got in, the carriages were all either
empty or with but one or two occupants. Now, I
said to myself, I should have done better to wait
till nearer the time of departure, and then chosen
my place.</p>

<p>I turned to reconnoitre my companion, but I
could not see his face clearly, as he was half leaning
out of the window. Was he doing so on purpose?
I said to myself, for naturally I was in a suspicious
mood. And as the thought struck me I half started
up, determined to choose another compartment.
Suddenly a peculiar sound made itself heard. My
companion was coughing. He drew his head in,
covering his face with his hand, as he coughed again.
You never heard such a curious cough. It was more
like a hen clucking than anything I can think of.
Once, twice he coughed; then, as if he had been
waiting for the slight spasm to pass, he sprang up,
looked eagerly out of the window again, and, opening
the door, jumped out, with some exclamation,
as if he had just caught sight of a friend.</p>

<p>And in another moment or two&mdash;he could barely
have had time to get in elsewhere&mdash;much to my
satisfaction, the train moved off.</p>

<p>"Now," thought I, "I can make myself comfortable
for some hours. We do not stop till M<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>:
it will be nine o'clock by then. If no one gets in
there I am safe to go through till to-morrow alone;
then there will only be <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Junction, and a clear
run to Calais."</p>

<p>I unstrapped my rug and lit a cigar&mdash;of course
I had chosen a smoking-carriage&mdash;and, delighted at
having got rid of my clucking companion, the time
passed pleasantly till we pulled up at M<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>. The
delay there was not great, and to my enormous
satisfaction no one molested my solitude. Evidently
the express to Calais was not in very great
demand that night. I now felt so secure that, notwithstanding
my intention of keeping awake all
night, my innermost consciousness had not I suppose
quite resigned itself to the necessity, for, not more
than a hour or so after leaving M<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, possibly
sooner, I fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I had slept heavily, for when
I awoke I had great difficulty in remembering where
I was. Only by slow degrees did I realise that I
was not in my comfortable bed at home, but in a
chilly, ill-lighted railway-carriage. Chilly&mdash;yes,
that it was&mdash;very chilly; but as my faculties returned
I remembered my precious bag, and forgot
all else in a momentary terror that it had been taken
from me. No; there it was&mdash;my elbow had been
pressed against it as I slept. But how was this?
The train was not in motion. We were standing in
a station; a dingy deserted-looking place, with no
cheerful noise or bustle; only one or two porters
slowly moving about, with a sort of sleepy "night
duty," surly air. It could not be the Junction?
I looked at my watch. Barely midnight! Of
course, not the Junction. We were not due there
till four o'clock in the morning or so.</p>

<p>What, then, were we doing here, and what
<i>was</i> "here"? Had there been an accident&mdash;some
unforeseen necessity for stopping? At that moment
a curious sound, from some yards' distance only it
seemed to come, caught my ear. It was that croaking,
cackling cough!&mdash;the cough of my momentary
fellow-passenger, towards whom I had felt an instinctive
aversion. I looked out of the window&mdash;there
was a refreshment-room just opposite, dimly
lighted, like everything else, and in the doorway, as
if just entering, was a figure which I felt pretty sure
was that of the man with the cough.</p>

<p>"Bah!" I said to myself, "I must not be fanciful.
I daresay the fellow's all right. He is
evidently in the same hole as myself. What in
Heaven's name are we waiting here for?"</p>

<p>I sprang out of the carriage, nearly tumbling over
a porter slowly passing along.</p>

<p>"How long are we to stay here?" I cried.
"When do we start again for <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?" and I named
the Junction.</p>

<p>"For <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" he repeated in the queerest German
I ever heard&mdash;was it German? or did I discover his
meaning by some preternatural cleverness of my
own? "There is no train for <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> for four or
five hours, not till<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" and he named the time;
and leaning forward lazily, he took out my larger
bag and my rug, depositing them on the platform.
He did not seem the least surprised at finding
me there&mdash;I might have been there for a week,
it seemed to me.</p>

<p>"No train for five hours? Are you mad?" I
said.</p>

<p>He shook his head and mumbled something, and
it seemed to me that he pointed to the refreshment-room
opposite. Gathering my things together I
hurried thither, hoping to find some more reliable
authority. But there was no one there except a
fat man with a white apron, who was clearing the
counter&mdash;and&mdash;yes, in one corner was the figure I
had mentally dubbed "The man with the cough".</p>

<p>I addressed the cook or waiter&mdash;whichever he
was. But he only shook his head&mdash;denied all
knowledge of the trains, but informed me that&mdash;in
other words&mdash;I must turn out; he was going to
shut up.</p>

<p>"And where am I to spend the night, then?" I
said angrily, though clearly it was not the aproned
individual who was responsible for the position in
which I found myself.</p>

<p>There was a "Restauration," he informed me,
near at hand, which I should find still open, straight
before me on leaving the station, and then a few
doors to the right, I would see the lights.</p>

<p>Clearly there was nothing else to be done. I
went out, and as I did so the silent figure in the
corner rose also and followed me. The station
was evidently going to bed. As I passed the
porter I repeated the hour he had named, adding:
"That is the first train for <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Junction?"</p>

<p>He nodded, again naming the exact time. But
I cannot do so, as I have never been able to recollect
it.</p>

<p>I trudged along the road&mdash;there were lamps,
though very feeble ones; but by their light I saw
that the man who had been in the refreshment-room
was still a few steps behind me. It made me
feel slightly nervous, and I looked round furtively
once or twice; the last time I did so he was not
to be seen, and I hoped he had gone some other
way.</p>

<p>The "Restauration" was scarcely more inviting
than the station refreshment-room. It, too, was
very dimly lighted, and the one or two attendants
seemed half asleep and were strangely silent. There
was a fire, of a kind, and I seated myself at a small
table near it and asked for some coffee, which
would, I thought, serve the double purpose of
warming me and keeping me awake.</p>

<p>It was brought me, in silence. I drank it, and
felt the better for it. But there was something so
gloomy and unsociable, so queer and almost weird
about the whole aspect and feeling of the place,
that a sort of irritable resignation took possession
of me. If these surly folk won't speak, neither
will I, I said to myself childishly. And, incredible
as it may sound, I did <i>not</i> speak. I think I paid
for the coffee, but I am not quite sure. I know I
never asked what I had meant to ask&mdash;the name of
the town&mdash;a place of some importance, to judge by
the size of the station and the extent of twinkling
lights I had observed as I made my way to the
"Restauration". From that day to this I have
never been able to identify it, and I am quite sure
I never shall.</p>

<p>What was there peculiar about that coffee?
Or was it something peculiar about my own condition
that caused it to have the unusual effect I now
experienced? That question, too, I cannot answer.
All I remember is feeling a sensation of irresistible
drowsiness creeping over me&mdash;mental, or moral I
may say, as well as physical. For when one part
of me feebly resisted the first onslaught of sleep,
something seemed to reply: "Oh, nonsense! you
have several hours before you. Your papers are
all right. No one can touch them without awaking
you."</p>

<p>And dreamily conscious that my belongings
were on the floor at my feet&mdash;<i>the</i> bag itself actually
resting against my ankle&mdash;my scruples silenced
themselves in an extraordinary way. I remember
nothing more, save a vague consciousness through
all my slumber of confused and chaotic dreams,
which I have never been able to recall.</p>

<p>I awoke at last, and that with a start, almost a
jerk. Something had awakened me&mdash;a sound&mdash;and
as it was repeated to my now aroused ears I
knew that I had heard it before, off and on, during
my sleep. It was the extraordinary cough!</p>

<p>I looked up. Yes, there he was! At some two
or three yards' distance only, at the other side of
the fireplace, which, and this I have forgotten to
mention as another peculiar item in that night's
peculiar experiences, considering I have every
reason to believe I was still in Germany, was not
a stove, but an open grate.</p>

<p>And he had not been there when I first fell
asleep; to that I was prepared to swear.</p>

<p>"He must have come sneaking in after me," I
thought, and in all probability I should neither
have noticed nor recognised him but for that
traitorous cackle of his.</p>

<p>Now, my misgivings aroused, my first thought,
of course, was for my precious charge. I stooped.
There were my rugs, my larger bag, but&mdash;no,
not the smaller one; and though the other two
were there, I knew at once that they were not quite
in the same position&mdash;not so close to me. Horror
seized me. Half wildly I gazed around, when my
silent neighbour bent towards me. I could declare
there was nothing in his hand when he did so, and
I could declare as positively that I had already
looked under the small round table beside which I
sat, and that the bag was not there. And yet when
the man, with a slight cackle, caused, no doubt, by
his stooping, raised himself, the thing was in his
hand!</p>

<p>Was he a conjurer, a pupil of Maskelyne and
Cook? And how was it that, even as he held out
my missing property, he managed, and that most
cleverly and unobtrusively, to prevent my catching
sight of his face? I did not see it then&mdash;I never
did see it!</p>

<p>Something he murmured, to the effect that he
supposed the bag was what I was looking for. In
what language he spoke I know not; it was more
that by the action accompanying the mumbled
sounds I gathered his meaning, than that I heard
anything articulate.</p>

<p>I thanked him, of course, mechanically, so to
say, though I began to feel as if he were an evil
spirit haunting me. I could only hope that the
splendid lock to the bag had defied all curiosity,
but I felt in a fever to be alone again, and able to
satisfy myself that nothing had been tampered with.</p>

<p>The thought recalled my wandering faculties.
How long had I been asleep? I drew out my
watch. Heavens! It was close upon the hour
named for the first train in the morning. I sprang
up, collected my things, and dashed out of the
"Restauration". If I had not paid for my coffee
before, I certainly did not pay for it then. Besides
my haste, there was another reason for this&mdash;there
was no one to pay to! Not a creature was to be
seen in the room or at the door as I passed out&mdash;always
excepting the man with the cough.</p>

<p>As I left the place and hurried along the road, a
bell began, not to ring, but to toll. It sounded
most uncanny. What it meant, of course, I have
never known. It may have been a summons to
the workpeople of some manufactory, it may have
been like all the other experiences of that strange
night. But no; this theory I will not at present
enter upon.</p>

<p>Dawn was not yet breaking, but there was in
one direction a faint suggestion of something of
the kind not far off. Otherwise all was dark. I
stumbled along as best as I could, helped in reality,
I suppose, by the ugly yellow glimmer of the woebegone
street, or road lamps. And it was not far
to the station, though somehow it seemed farther
than when I came; and somehow, too, it seemed
to have grown steep, though I could not remember
having noticed any slope the other way on my
arrival. A nightmare-like sensation began to
oppress me. I felt as if my luggage was growing
momentarily heavier and heavier, as if I should
<i>never</i> reach the station; and to this was joined the
agonising terror of missing the train.</p>

<p>I made a desperate effort. Cold as it was, the
beads of perspiration stood out upon my forehead
as I forced myself along. And by degrees the
nightmare feeling cleared off. I found myself
entering the station at a run just as&mdash;yes, a train
was actually beginning to move! I dashed, baggage
and all, into a compartment; it was empty, and
it was a second-class one, precisely similar to the one
I had occupied before; it might have been the very
same one. The train gradually increased its speed,
but for the first few moments, while still in the
station and passing through its immediate <i>entourage</i>,
another strange thing struck me&mdash;the extraordinary
silence and lifelessness of all about. Not one
human being did I see, no porter watching our
departure with the faithful though stolid interest
always to be seen on the porter's visage. I might
have been alone in the train&mdash;it might have had a
freight of the dead, and been itself propelled by
some supernatural agency, so noiselessly, so gloomily
did it proceed.</p>

<p>You will scarcely credit that I actually and for
the third time fell asleep. I could not help it.
Some occult influence was at work upon me
throughout those dark hours, I am positively
certain. And with the daylight it was dispelled.
For when I again awoke I felt for the first time
since leaving home completely and normally myself,
fresh and vigorous, all my faculties at their best.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, my first sensation was a start
of amazement, almost of terror. The compartment
was nearly full! There were at least five or
six travellers besides myself, very respectable,
ordinary-looking folk, with nothing in the least
alarming about them. Yet it was with a gasp of
extraordinary relief that I found my precious bag
in the corner beside me, where I had carefully
placed it. It was concealed from view. No one,
I felt assured, could have touched it without
awaking me.</p>

<p>It was broad and bright daylight. How long
had I slept?</p>

<p>"Can you tell me," I inquired of my opposite
neighbour, a cheery-faced compatriot&mdash;"Can you
tell me how soon we get to <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Junction by this
train? I am most anxious to catch the evening mail
at Calais, and am quite out in my reckonings,
owing to an extraordinary delay at <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>. I have
wasted the night by getting into a stopping train
instead of the express."</p>

<p>He looked at me in astonishment. He must
have thought me either mad or just awaking from
a fit of intoxication&mdash;only I flatter myself I did not
look as if the latter were the case.</p>

<p>"How soon we get to <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Junction?" he
repeated. "Why, my good sir, you left it about
three hours ago! It is now eight o'clock. We
all got in at the Junction. You were alone, if I
mistake not?"&mdash;he glanced at one or two of the
others, who endorsed his statement. "And very
fast asleep you were, and must have been, not to
be disturbed by the bustle at the station. And as
for catching the evening boat at Calais"&mdash;he burst
into a loud guffaw&mdash;"why, it would be very hard
lines to do no better than that! <i>We</i> all hope to
cross by the mid-day one."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;what train <i>is</i> this?" I exclaimed,
utterly perplexed.</p>

<p>"The express, of course. All of us, excepting
yourself, joined it at the Junction," he replied.</p>

<p>"The express?" I repeated. "The express
that leaves"&mdash;and I named my own town&mdash;"at
six in the evening?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. You have got into the right train
after all," and here came another shout of amusement.
"How did you think we had all got in
if you had not yet passed the Junction? You had
not the pleasure of our company from M<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, I
take it? M<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, which you passed at nine
o'clock last night, if my memory is correct."</p>

<p>"Then," I persisted, "this is the double-fast
express, which does not stop between M<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
your Junction?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," he repeated; and then, confirmed
most probably in his belief that I was mad, or the
other thing, he turned to his newspaper, and left
me to my extraordinary cogitations.</p>

<p>Had I been dreaming? Impossible! Every
sensation, the very taste of the coffee, seemed still
present with me&mdash;the curious accent of the officials
at the mysterious town, I could perfectly recall.
I still shivered at the remembrance of the chilly
waking in the "Restauration"; I heard again the
cackling cough.</p>

<p>But I felt I must collect myself, and be ready
for the important negotiation entrusted to me.
And to do this I must for the time banish these
fruitless efforts at solving the problem.</p>

<p>We had a good run to Calais, found the boat in
waiting, and a fair passage brought us prosperously
across the Channel. I found myself in London
punctual to the intended hour of my arrival.</p>

<p>At once I drove to the lodgings in a small
street off the Strand which I was accustomed to
frequent in such circumstances. I felt nervous till
I had an opportunity of thoroughly overhauling
my documents. The bag had been opened by the
Custom House officials, but the words "private
papers" had sufficed to prevent any further examination;
and to my unspeakable delight they were
intact. A glance satisfied me as to this the
moment I got them out, for they were most
carefully numbered.</p>

<p>The next morning saw me early on my way to&mdash;No.
909, we will say&mdash;Blackfriars Street, where
was the office of Messrs. Bluestone &amp; Fagg. I
had never been there before, but it was easy to
find, and had I felt any doubt, their name stared
me in the face at the side of the open doorway.
"Second-floor" I thought I read; but when I
reached the first landing I imagined I must have
been mistaken. For there, at a door ajar, stood
an eminently respectable-looking gentleman, who
bowed as he saw me, with a discreet smile.</p>

<p>"Herr Schmidt?" he said. "Ah, yes; I was
on the look-out for you."</p>

<p>I felt a little surprised, and my glance
involuntarily strayed to the doorway. There was no
name upon it, and it appeared to have been freshly
painted. My new friend saw my glance.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he said; "we have the painters
here. We are using these lower rooms temporarily.
I was watching to prevent your having the trouble
of mounting to the second-floor."</p>

<p>And as I followed him in, I caught sight of a
painter's ladder&mdash;a small one&mdash;on the stair above,
and the smell was also unmistakable.</p>

<p>The large outer office looked bare and empty,
but under the circumstances that was natural. No
one was, at the first glance, to be seen; but
behind a dulled glass partition screening off one
corner I fancied I caught sight of a seated figure.
And an inner office, to which my conductor led the
way, had a more comfortable and inhabited look.
Here stood a younger man. He bowed politely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fagg, my junior," said the first individual
airily. "And now, Herr Schmidt, to business at
once, if you please. Time is everything. You
have all the documents ready?"</p>

<p>I answered by opening my bag and spreading
out its contents. Both men were very grave,
almost taciturn; but as I proceeded to explain
things it was easy to see that they thoroughly
understood all I said.</p>

<p>"And now," I went on, when I had reached a
certain point, "if you will give me Nos. 7 and
13 which you have already received by registered
post, I can put you in full possession of the whole.
Without them, of course, all I have said is, so to
say, preliminary only."</p>

<p>The two looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the elder man, "I follow what
you say. The key of the whole is wanting. But
I was momentarily expecting you to bring it out.
We have not&mdash;Fagg, I am right, am I not&mdash;we
have received nothing by post?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," replied his junior. And
the answer seemed simplicity itself. Why did a
strange thrill of misgiving go through me? Was
it something in the look that had passed between
them? Perhaps so. In any case, strange to say,
the inconsistency between their having received no
papers and yet looking for my arrival at the hour
mentioned in the letter accompanying the documents,
and accosting me by name, did not strike
me till some hours later.</p>

<p>I threw off what I believed to be my ridiculous
mistrust, and it was not difficult to do so in my
extreme annoyance.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," I said. "It is really
too bad. Everything depends upon 7 and 13. I
must telegraph at once for inquiries to be instituted
at the post-office."</p>

<p>"But your people must have duplicates," said
Fagg eagerly. "These can be forwarded at once."</p>

<p>"I hope so," I said, though feeling strangely
confused and worried.</p>

<p>"They must send them direct <i>here</i>," he went on.</p>

<p>I did not at once answer. I was gathering my
papers together.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," he proceeded, touching
my bag, "you had better leave <i>these</i> here. We
will lock them up in the safe at once. It is better
than carrying them about London."</p>

<p>It certainly seemed so. I half laid down the bag
on the table, but at that moment from the outer
room a most peculiar sound caught my ears&mdash;a
faint cackling cough! I <i>think</i> I concealed my
start. I turned away as if considering Fagg's suggestion,
which, to confess the truth, I had been on
the very point of agreeing to. For it would have
been a great relief to me to know that the papers
were in safe custody. But now a flash of lurid
light seemed to have transformed everything.</p>

<p>"I thank you," I replied. "I should be glad to
be free from the responsibility of the charge, but
I dare not let these out of my own hands till the
agreement is formally signed."</p>

<p>The younger man's face darkened. He assumed
a bullying tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it strikes <i>you</i>, Mr. Bluestone,"
he said, "but it seems to me that this young
gentleman is going rather too far. Do you think
your employers will be pleased to hear of your
insulting us, sir?"</p>

<p>But the elder man smiled condescendingly,
though with a touch of superciliousness. It was
very well done. He waved his hand.</p>

<p>"Stay, my dear Mr. Fagg; we can well afford
to make allowance. You will telegraph at once,
no doubt, Herr Schmidt, and&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes,
we shall receive the duplicates of Nos. 7 and 13
by first post on Thursday morning."</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>"Exactly," I replied, as I lifted the now locked
bag. "And you may expect me at the same hour
on Thursday morning."</p>

<p>Then I took my departure, accompanied to the
door by the urbane individual who had received
me.</p>

<p>The telegram which I at once despatched was
not couched precisely as he would have dictated, I
allow. And he would have been considerably
surprised at my sending off another, later in the
day, to Bluestone &amp; Fagg's telegraphic address, in
these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unavoidably detained till Thursday morning.&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Schmidt</span>."</p>

<p>This was <i>after</i> the arrival of a wire from home
in answer to mine.</p>

<p>By Thursday morning I had had time to receive
a letter from Herr Wilhelm, and to secure the
services of a certain noted detective, accompanied
by whom I presented myself at the appointed hour
at 909. But my companion's services were not
required. The birds had flown, warned by the
same traitor in our camp through whom the first
hints of the new patent had leaked out. With
him it was easy to deal, poor wretch! but the
clever rogues who had employed him and personated
the members of the honourable firm of
Bluestone &amp; Fagg were never traced.</p>

<p>The negotiation was successfully carried out.
The experience I had gone through left me a wiser
man. It is to be hoped, too, that the owners of
909 Blackfriars Street were more cautious in the
future as to whom they let their premises to when
temporarily vacant. The re-painting of the doorway,
etc., at the tenant's own expense had already
roused some slight suspicion.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that Nos. 7 and 13 had
been duly received on the second-floor.</p>

<p>I have never known the true history of that extraordinary
night. Was it all a dream, or a prophetic
vision of warning? Or was it in any sense
true? <i>Had</i> I, in some inexplicable way, left my
own town earlier than I intended, and really
travelled in a slow train?</p>

<p>Or had the man with a cough, for his own
nefarious purposes, mesmerised or hypnotised me,
and to some extent succeeded?</p>

<p>I cannot say. Sometimes, even, I ask myself if
I am quite sure that there ever was such a person
as "the man with the cough"!</p>

<h3><a name="st_III" id="st_III"></a>"HALF-WAY BETWEEN THE STILES."</h3>

<h4>(A RIGHT-OF-WAY INCIDENT.)</h4>

<p>By the road, Scarby village is good three miles
from Colletwood, the nearest town and railway
station. But there is a short cut over the hills
for foot passengers. <i>Over</i> the hills they call it,
but <i>between</i> the hills would be more correct, for
there is a sort of tableland once you have climbed
a short, steep bit up from the town, which extends
nearly to Scarby, sloping gradually down to the
village.</p>

<p>And on each side of this tableland the hills rise
again, north and south, much higher to the north
than to the south. So this flat stretch, though at
some considerable height, is neither bleak nor
exposed, being sheltered on the colder side, and
fairly open to the sunshine south and west.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant place, and so it must have been
considered in the old days; for a large monastery
stood there once, of which the ruins are still to be
seen, and of which the memory is still preserved in
the name&mdash;"Monksholdings".</p>

<p>Pleasant, but a trifle inconvenient, as the only
carriage-road makes a great round from Colletwood,
winding along the base of the hill on the north
side till it reaches the village, then up again by the
gradual slope, half a mile or so&mdash;a drive in all of
three to four miles, whereas, as the bird flies or the
pedestrian walks, the distance from the town is
barely a quarter of that.</p>

<p>In the old days there was probably no road at all,
the hill-path doubtless serving all requirements.
Naturally enough, therefore, it came to be looked
upon as entirely public property, and people forgot&mdash;if,
indeed, any one had ever thought of it&mdash;that
though the monastery was a ruin, the once carefully
kept land round about the old dwelling-place of
Monksholdings was still private property.</p>

<p>And the sensation was great when suddenly the
news reached the neighbourhood that this "unique
estate," as the agents called it, was sold&mdash;sold by
the old Duke of Scarshire, who scarcely remembered
that he owned it, to a man who meant to live on
it, to build a house which should be a home for
several months of the year for himself and his
family.</p>

<p>There was considerable growling and grumbling;
and this rose to its height when a rumour got about
that the hill-path&mdash;such part of it, that is to say, as
lay within the actual demesne&mdash;was to be closed&mdash;<i>must</i>
be closed, if the site already chosen for the
new house was to be retained; for the house would
actually stand upon the old foot-track, and there
could be no two opinions that this position had
been well and wisely selected.</p>

<p>Things grew warlike, boding no agreeable reception
for the newcomers&mdash;a Mr. Raynald and his
family, newcomers to England, it was said, as well
as to Scarshire. Every one plunged into questions
of right-of-way; the local legalities raised and
discussed knotty points; Colletwood and Scarby
were aflame. But it all ended, flatly enough, in a
compromise!</p>

<p>Mr. Raynald turned out to be one of the most
reasonable and courteous of men. He came, saw,
and&mdash;conquered. The goodwill of his future
neighbours was won e'er he knew he had risked its
loss. Henceforward congratulations, reciprocated
and repeated, on the charming additions to Scarby
society were the order of the day, and the <i>d&eacute;tour</i>,
skirting the south boundary of the Monksholdings
grounds, which the footpath was now inveigled into
making, was voted "a great improvement".</p>

<p>And in due time the mansion rose.</p>

<p>"A great improvement" also, to the aspect of the
surrounding landscape. It was in perfectly good
taste&mdash;unpretentious and quietly picturesque. It
might have been there always for any jarring protest
to the contrary.</p>

<p>And just half-way along the old foot-track, that
is to say, between the two stiles which let the
traveller to or from Scarby in or out of the Monksholdings
demesne, stood Sybil Raynald's grand
piano!</p>

<p>The stiles remained as an interesting survival;
but they were made use of by no one not bound
for the house itself. And beside each was a gate&mdash;a
good oaken gate, that suited the place, as did
everything about it; and beside each gate a quaint
miniature dwelling, one of which came to be known
as the east, and the other as the west, Monksholdings
lodge.</p>

<p>The first time the Raynalds came down to their
new home they made but a short stay there. It
was already late in the season, and though the preceding
summer had been a magnificent one for
drying fresh walls and plaster, it would scarcely
have done to risk damp or chilly weather in so
recently-built a house.</p>

<p>They stayed long enough to confirm the
favourable impression the head of the family
had already made, and to lead themselves to
look forward with pleasure to a less curtailed stay
in Scarshire.</p>

<p>The last morning of their visit, Sybil, the eldest
daughter, up and about betimes, turned to her
father, when she had taken her place beside him
at the breakfast-table, with a suspicion of annoyance
on her usually cheerful face.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, "I have seen that old man
<i>again</i>, leaning on the stile by the Scarby lodge
and looking in&mdash;along the drive&mdash;<i>so</i> queerly. I
don't quite like it. It gave me rather a ghosty
feeling; or else he is out of his mind."</p>

<p>Her brother, Mark by name, began to laugh,
after the manner of brothers.</p>

<p>"How very oddly you express yourself!" he
said. "I should like to experience 'a ghosty
feeling'. A ghost is just what this place wants to
make it perfect. But it should be the spirit of one
of the original monks."</p>

<p>Mr. Raynald turned to his son rather sharply.</p>

<p>"I don't want any nonsense of that kind set
about, Mark," he said. "It would frighten the
younger children when they come down here. I
will ask about the old man. It is quite possible
he is half-witted, or something of that sort. I
forgot about it when Sybil mentioned it before.
But no doubt he is perfectly harmless. Has no
one seen him but you, Sybil?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"None of <i>us</i>," she replied. "And I wasn't
exactly frightened. There was something very
pathetic about him. He looked at me closely,
murmuring some words, and then shook his head.
That was all."</p>

<p>But just then her father was called away to give
some last directions, and in the bustle of hurry to
catch their train the matter passed from the minds
of the younger as well as the elder members of the
family.</p>

<p>It returned to Sybil's memory, however, when
she found herself in their London house again, and
called upon by her younger sisters to relate every
detail of Monksholdings and its neighbourhood.
But mindful of her father's warning, she said
nothing to Esther or Annis of the figure at the
gate. It was only to Miss March&mdash;Ellinor March&mdash;the
dearly-loved governess, who was more friend
than teacher to her three pupils, that she spoke of
it, late in the evening, when the younger ones had
gone to bed, and her father and mother were busy
with Indian letters in Mr. Raynald's study.</p>

<p>The two girls, we may say&mdash;for Ellinor was still
some years under thirty&mdash;were alone in the drawing-room.
Ellinor had been playing something tender
and faintly weird&mdash;it died away under her fingers,
and she sat on at the piano in silence.</p>

<p>Sybil spoke suddenly.</p>

<p>"That is <i>so</i> melancholy," she said, "something
so long ago about it, like the ghost of a sorrow
rather than a sorrow itself. I know&mdash;I know
what it makes me think of. Listen, Ellinor."</p>

<p>For out of school hours the two threw formality
aside. And Sybil told of the sad, wistful old face
looking over the stile.</p>

<p>"Now it has come back to me," she said, "I
can't forget it."</p>

<p>Ellinor, too, was impressed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it sounds very pitiful. Who
knows what tragedy is bound up in it?" and she
sighed.</p>

<p>Sybil understood her. Miss March's own history
was a strange one.</p>

<p>"We must find out about it when we go down
to Monksholdings next year," she said.</p>

<p>"And perhaps," added Ellinor, "even if he is
half-witted, we might do something to comfort
the poor man."</p>

<p>Sybil hesitated.</p>

<p>"Then you don't think he can be a ghost?" she
said, looking half ashamed of the suggestion.</p>

<p>Miss March smiled&mdash;her smile was sad.</p>

<p>"In one sense, no, I should think it highly improbable;
in another, yes, there must be the ghost
of some great sorrow about the face you describe,"
she said.</p>

<p>So there was.</p>

<p>This is the story.</p>

<p>At the farther end of Scarby village&mdash;the farther
end, that is to say, from Monksholdings and the
path between the hills&mdash;the road drops again
somewhat suddenly. Only for a short distance,
however; Mayling Farm&mdash;"Giles's" as it is
colloquially called&mdash;which is the first house you
come to when you reach level ground again, being
by no means low lying.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the west windows command a
grand view of the great Scarshire plain beneath,
bordered by the faint hazy blue, scarcely to be
distinguished from clouds, of the long range of
hills concealing the far-off glimmer of the ocean,
which otherwise might sometimes be perceptible.</p>

<p>Mayling is a very old place, and the Giles's had
been there "always," so to speak&mdash;steady-going,
unambitious, save as regards their farming and its
success; they had been just the make of men to
settle on to their ground as if it and they could
have no existence apart. A fine race physically as
well as morally, though some twenty-five years or
so before the Raynalds bought Monksholdings, a
run of ill luck, a whole chapter of casualties, had
brought them down to but one representative,
and he scarcely the typical Farmer Giles of
Mayling.</p>

<p>This was Barnett, the youngest of four stalwart
sons; the youngest and the only survivor. He
was already forty when his father died, earnestly
commending to him the "old place," which even
at eighty the aged farmer felt himself better fitted
to manage than the somewhat delicate, sensitive
man whom his brothers had made good-natured
fun of in his youth as a "book-worm".</p>

<p>But Barnett was intelligent and sensible, and he
rose to the occasion. Circumstances helped him.
The year after old Giles's death Barnett for the
first time fell in love, wisely and well. His affection
was bestowed on a worthy object&mdash;Marion
Grover, the daughter of a yeoman in the next
county&mdash;and was fully returned.</p>

<p>Marion was years younger than her lover,
fifteen at least, eminently practical, healthy, and
pretty. She brought her husband just exactly
what he was most in need of&mdash;brightness, energy,
and youth. It was an ideal marriage, and everything
prospered at Mayling. Four years after the
advent of the new Mrs. Giles you would scarcely
have recognised the farmer, he seemed another man.</p>

<p>He adored his wife, and could hardly find it in
his heart to regret that their child was not a son,
even though, failing an heir, the old name must
die out; for if there was one creature the husband
and wife loved more than each other it was their
baby girl.</p>

<p>A month or two after this child's second birthday
the singular catastrophe occurred which changed
the world to poor Barnett Giles, leaving him but
a wreck of his former self, physically and mentally.</p>

<p>Young Mrs. Giles was strong in every way, and
from the first she took the line of saving her
husband all extra fatigue or annoyance which she
could possibly hoist on to her own brave shoulders.
There was something quaint and even pathetic
in the relations of the couple. For, notwithstanding
Marion's being so much Barnett's junior, her
attitude towards him had a decided suggestion of
the maternal about it, though at times of real emergency
his sound judgment and advice never failed
her. It was within a week or two of Christmas;
the weather was bitingly, raspingly cold. And
though as yet no snow had fallen, the weather-wise
were predicting it daily.</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> go over to Colletwood this week,"
said Mrs. Giles, "and I must take Nelly. Her
new coat is waiting to be tried at the dressmaker's,
and I must get her some boots and several other
things before Christmas. And there is a whole
list of other shopping too&mdash;all our Christmas
presents to see to."</p>

<p>Her husband was looking out of the window,
it was still very early in the day.</p>

<p>"I doubt if the snow will hold off much longer,"
he said.</p>

<p>"And once it begins it may be heavy," his wife
replied, "and then I might not be able to go for
ever so long, even by the road,"&mdash;for a deep fall
of snow at Scarby was practically a stoppage to
all traffic. "I'll tell you what, Barnett, we'll
go to-day and make sure of it. I will put other
things aside and start before noon. A couple of
hours, or three at the most, will do everything,
and then Nelly and I will be back long before
dark. You'll come to meet us, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will&mdash;if you go. But," and again
he glanced at the sky. The morning was, so far,
clear and bright, though very cold, but over
towards the north there was a suspicious look
about the blue-grey clouds. "I don't know,"
he said, "but that you'd better wait till to-morrow
and see if it blows off again."</p>

<p>But Marion shook her head.</p>

<p>"I've a feeling," she said, "that if I don't go
to-day, I won't go at all. And I really must.
I'll take Betsy to carry the child till we're just
above the town, and then send her home, so
as not to be tired for coming back. Not
that I'm <i>ever</i> tired, as you know," with a
smile.</p>

<p>He gave in, only stipulating that at all costs
they should start to return by a certain hour,
unless the snow should have already begun, in
which case Marion was to run no risks, but either
to hire a fly to bring her home by the road, or to
stay in the town with some of her friends till the
weather cleared again.</p>

<p>"And I'll meet you," he added. "Let us set
our watches together&mdash;I'll start from here so as to
be at&mdash;let me see<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Half-way between the stiles," said Marion.
"We can each see the other from one stile to the
opposite one, you know, even though it's a good
bit of a way. Yes, dear, I'll time it as near as I
can to meet half-way between the stiles."</p>

<p>And with these words the last on her lips, she
set off, a picture of health and happiness&mdash;little
Nelly crowing back to "Dada" from over stout
Betsy's shoulder.</p>

<p>Betsy was home again within the hour.</p>

<p>But the mother and child&mdash;alas and alas! It
was the immortal story of "Lucy Gray" in an
almost more pathetic shape.</p>

<p>Farmer Giles, as I have said, was a studious,
often absent-minded man. There was not much
to do at that season and in such weather, and what
there was, some amount of supervision on his part
was enough for. After his early dinner he got out
his books for an hour or two's quiet reading till it
should be time to set off to meet his darlings. No
fear of his forgetting <i>that</i> time, but till the clock
struck, and he saw it was approaching nearly, he
never looked out&mdash;he was unconscious of the rapid
growth of the lurid, steely clouds; he had no idea
that the snowflakes were already falling, falling,
more and more closely and thickly with each
instant that passed.</p>

<p>Then rose the storm spirit and issued his orders&mdash;all
too quickly obeyed. Before Barnett Giles
had left the village street he found himself in what
now-a-days would be called a "blizzard". And
his pale face grew paler, and his heart beat as if
to choke him, when at last he reached the first stile
and stood there panting, to regain his breath. It
was all he could do to battle on through the fury
of the wind, the blinding, whirling snow, which
seemed to envelop him as if in sheets. Not for
many and many a day will that awful snowstorm
be forgotten in Scarshire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was at the appointed trysting place they found
him&mdash;"half-way between the stiles". But not
till late that evening, when Betsy, more alarmed
by his absence than by her mistress's not returning,
at last struggled out through the deep-lying snow
to alarm the nearest neighbours.</p>

<p>"The missis and Miss Nell will have stayed the
night in the town," she said. "But I misdoubt
me if the master will ever have got so far, though
he may have been tempted on when he did not
meet them."</p>

<p>By this time the fury of the storm had spent
itself, and they found poor Giles after a not very
protracted search, and brought him home&mdash;dead,
they thought at first.</p>

<p>No, he was not dead, but it was less than half
<i>life</i> that he returned to. For his first inquiry late
the next day, when glimmering consciousness had
begun to revive&mdash;"Marion, the baby?"&mdash;seemed
by some subtle instinct to answer itself truthfully,
in spite of the kindly endeavour to deceive him for
the time.</p>

<p>"Dead!" he murmured. "I knew it. Half-way
between the stiles," and he turned his face to
the wall.</p>

<p>They almost wished he had died too&mdash;the rough
but kind-hearted country-folk who were his
neighbours. But he lived. He never asked and
never knew the details of the tragedy, which,
indeed, was never fully known by any one.</p>

<p>All that came to light was that the dead body of
Marion Giles was brought by some semi-gipsy
wanderers to the workhouse of a town several miles
south of Colletwood, early on the morning after
the blizzard. They had found it, they said, at
some little distance from the road along which they
were journeying, so that she must have lost her
way long before approaching the Monksholdings
confines, not improbably, indeed, in attempting to
retrace her steps to the town which she had so imprudently
quitted. But of the child the tramps
said nothing, and after making the above deposition,
they were allowed to go on their way, which
they expressed themselves as anxious to do; for
reasons of their own, no doubt; possibly the same
reasons which had prevented their returning to
Colletwood with the young woman's corpse, as
would have seemed more natural.</p>

<p>And afterwards no very special inquiry was made
about the baby. The father was incapable of it,
and in those days people accepted things more carelessly,
perhaps. It was taken for granted that
"Little Nell" had fallen down some cliff, no
doubt, and lay buried there, with the snow for her
shroud, like a strayed lambkin. Her tiny bones
might yet be found, years hence, maybe, by a
shepherd in search of some bleating wanderer, or&mdash;no
more might ever be known of the infant's
fate!</p>

<p>Barnett Giles rose from his bed, after many
weeks, with all the look of a very old man. At first
it was thought that his mind was quite gone; but
it did not prove to be so. After a time, with the
help of an excellent foreman, or bailiff, he showed
himself able to manage his farm with a strange,
mechanical kind of intelligence. It seemed as if
the sense of duty outlived the loss of other perceptions,
though these, too, cleared by degrees to
a considerable extent, and material things, curious
as it may appear, prospered with him.</p>

<p>But he rarely spoke unless obliged to do so;
and whenever he felt himself at leisure, and knew
that his work was not calling for him, he seemed
to relapse into the half-dreamy state which was his
more real life. Then he would pass through the
village and slowly climb the slope to the stile,
where he would stand for hours together, patiently
gazing before him, while he murmured the old
refrain: "'Half-way between the stiles,' she said.
I shall meet them there, 'half-way between the
stiles'."</p>

<p>Fortunately, perhaps, it was not often he attempted
to climb over; he contented himself with
standing and gazing. Fortunately so, for otherwise
the changes at Monksholdings would have
probably terribly shocked his abnormally sensitive
brain. But he did not seem to notice them, nor
the new route of the old right-of-way agreed to by
the compromise. He was content with his post&mdash;standing,
leaning on the stile, and gazing before
him.</p>

<p>His, of course, was the worn, wistful face which
had half frightened, half appealed to Sybil Raynald.</p>

<p>But she forgot about it again, or other things
put it temporarily aside, so that when the Raynalds
came down to Monksholdings again the following
Easter it did not at once occur to her to remind
her father of the inquiry he had promised to
make.</p>

<p>Miss March was not with her pupils and their
parents at first. She had gone to spend a holiday
week with the friends who had brought her up
and seen to her education&mdash;good, benevolent
people, if not specially sympathetic, but to whom
she felt herself bound by ties of sincerest gratitude,
though her five years with the Raynald family had
given her more of the feeling of a "home"
than she had ever had before.</p>

<p>And her arrival at Monksholdings was the
occasion of much rejoicing. There was everything
to show her, and every one, from Mark down to
little Robin, wanted to be her guide. It was not
till the morning of the next day that Sybil managed
to get her to herself for a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> stroll.</p>

<p>Ellinor had some things to tell her quondam
pupil. Mrs. Bellairs, her self-appointed guardian,
was growing old and somewhat feeble.</p>

<p>"I fear she is not likely to live many years,"
said Miss March, "and she thinks so herself.
She has a curious longing, which I never saw in
her before, to find out my history&mdash;to know if
there is no one really belonging to me to whom
she can give me back, as it were, before she dies.
She gave me the little parcel containing the clothes
I had on when she rescued me from being sent to
a workhouse. They are carefully washed and
mended, and though I was a poor, dirty little object
when I was found, they do not look really as if
I had been a beggar child," with a little smile.</p>

<p>"You a beggar child!" exclaimed Sybil indignantly.
"Of course not. Perhaps, on the
contrary, you were somebody very grand."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Ellinor sensibly. "In that case
I should have been advertised for and inquired
after. No, I have never thought that, and I
should not wish it. I should be more than thankful
to know I came of good, honest people, however
simple; to have some one of my very own."</p>

<p>"I forget the actual details," said Sybil, "though
you have often told me about it. You were found&mdash;no,
not literally in the workhouse, was it?"</p>

<p>"They were going to take me there," said Miss
March. "It was at a village near Bath where Mr.
and Mrs. Bellairs were then living, and one day,
after a party of gipsies had been encamping on the
common, a cottager's wife heard something crying
in the night, and found me in her little garden.
She was too poor to keep me herself, and felt
certain I was a child the gipsies had stolen and
then wanted to get rid of. I was fair-haired and
blue-eyed, not like them. She was a friend or
relation of some of Mrs. Bellairs's servants, and so
the story got round to my kind old friend. And
you know the rest&mdash;how they first thought of
bringing me up in quite a humble way, and then
finding me&mdash;well, intelligent and naturally rather
refined, I suppose, I got a really good education,
and my good luck did not desert me, dear, when
I came to be your governess."</p>

<p>Sybil smiled.</p>

<p>"And can you remember <i>nothing</i>?"</p>

<p>Ellinor hesitated.</p>

<p>"Queer, dreamy fragments come back to me
sometimes," she said. "I have a feeling of having
seen hills long, long ago. It is strange," she went
on, for by this time they had left the private
grounds and were strolling along the hill-path in
the direction of the town, "it is strange that since
I came here I seem to have got hold of a tiny bit
of these old memories, if they are such. It must
be the hills," and she stood still and gazed round
her with a deep breath of satisfaction, "I could
only have been between two and three when I was
found," she went on. "The only words I said
were 'Dada' and 'Nennie'&mdash;it sounded like
'Nelly'. That was why Mrs. Bellairs called me
'Ellinor,' and 'March,' because it was in that
month she took me to her house."</p>

<p>Sybil walked on in silence for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> such a romantic story," she said at last.
"I am never tired of thinking about it."</p>

<p>They entered Monksholdings again from the
east entrance, Ellinor glanced at the stile.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye," she said, "this is one of the two
old stiles, I suppose. Have you ever seen your
ghost again, Sybil? Have you found out anything
about him?"</p>

<p>Sybil looked round her half nervously.</p>

<p>"It is the other stile he haunts," she said. "I
rather avoid it, at least, I mean to do so now. It
is curious you speak of it, for till yesterday I had
not seen him again, and had almost forgotten
about it. But yesterday afternoon, just before
you came, there he was&mdash;exactly the same, staring
in. I meant to speak to papa about it, but with
the pleasure and bustle of your arrival, I forgot
it. Remind me about it. I am afraid he is out
of his mind."</p>

<p>"Poor old man!" said Ellinor. "I wish we
could do something to comfort him. I feel as if
everybody <i>must</i> be happy here. It is such a
charming, exhilarating place. Dear me, how
windy it is! The path is all strewn with the
white petals of the cherry blossom."</p>

<p>"They have degenerated into wild cherry trees,"
said Sybil. "Long ago papa says these must have
been good fruit trees of many kinds, and this is a
great cherry country, you know."</p>

<p>The wind dropped that afternoon, but only
temporarily. It rose again so much during the
night that by the next morning the grounds
looked, to use little Annis's expression, "quite
untidy".</p>

<p>"And down in the village, or just beyond it,"
said Mark, who had been for an early stroll, "at
one place it really looks as if it had been snowing.
The road skirts that old farmhouse; you know it,
father? I forget the name&mdash;there's a grand cherry
orchard there."</p>

<p>"'Mayling Farm,' you must mean," said Mr.
Raynald. "Farmer Giles's. Oh, by the way,
that reminds me, Sybil," but a glance round the
table made him stop short. They were at breakfast.
He scarcely felt inclined to relate the tragic
story before the younger children, "they might
look frightened or run away if they came across
the poor fellow," he reflected. "I will tell Sybil
about it afterwards."</p>

<p>Easter holidays were not yet over, though the
governess had returned, so regular routine was set
aside, and the whole of the young party, Ellinor
included, spent that morning in a scramble among
the hills.</p>

<p>The children seemed untirable, and set off again
somewhere or other in the afternoon. Sybil was
busy with her mother, writing letters and orders
to be despatched to London, so that towards four
o'clock or so, when Miss March, having finished
her own correspondence, entered the drawing-room,
she found it deserted.</p>

<p>Sybil had promised to practise some duets with
her, and while waiting on the chance of her coming,
Ellinor seated herself at the piano and began to
play&mdash;nothing very important&mdash;just snatches of
old airs which she wove into a kind of half-dreamy
harmony, one melting into another as they occurred
to her.</p>

<p>All at once a shadow fell on the keys, and then
she remembered having heard the door softly open
a moment or two before&mdash;so softly, that she had
not looked round, imagining it to be the wind,
which, though fallen now, still lingered about.</p>

<p>Now her ideas took another shape.</p>

<p>"It is Sybil, no doubt," she thought with a smile.
"She is going to make me jump," and she waited,
half expecting to feel Sybil's hands suddenly clasped
over her eyes from behind.</p>

<p>But this was not to be the mode of attack,
apparently, though she heard what sounded like
stealthy footsteps.</p>

<p>"You need not try to startle me, Sybbie," she
exclaimed laughingly, without turning or ceasing
to play, "I hear you."</p>

<p>It was no laughing voice which replied.</p>

<p>On the contrary, a sigh, almost a groan, close to
her made her look up sharply&mdash;a trifle indignant
perhaps at the joke being carried so far&mdash;and she
saw, a pace or two from her only, the figure of an
old man&mdash;a white-haired, somewhat bent form, a
worn face with wistful blue eyes&mdash;gazing at her.</p>

<p>She had scarcely time to feel frightened, for
almost instantaneously Sybil's "ghost" recurred
to her memory.</p>

<p>"He has found his way in, then," she thought,
not without a slight and natural tremor, which,
however, disappeared as she gazed, so pathetically
gentle was the whole aspect of the intruder.</p>

<p>But&mdash;his face changed curiously&mdash;the sight of
hers, now fully in his view, seemed strangely to
affect him. With a gesture of utter bewilderment
he raised his hand to his forehead as if to brush
something away&mdash;the cloud still resting on his
brain&mdash;then a smile broke over the old face, a
wonderful smile.</p>

<p>"Marion," he said, "at last? I&mdash;I thought I
was dreaming. I heard you playing in my dream.
It is the right place though, 'Half-way between
the stiles,' you said. I have waited so long and
come so often, and now it is snowing again. Just
a little, dear, nothing to hurt. Marion, my
darling, why don't you speak? Is it all a dream&mdash;this
fine room, the music and all? Are <i>you</i> a
dream?"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes as if he were fainting. Inexpressibly
touched, all Ellinor's womanly nature
went out to him. She started forward, half leading,
half lifting him to a seat close at hand.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am not Marion," she said, and afterwards
she wondered what had inspired the
words, "but I am"&mdash;not "Ellinor," something
made her change the name as he spoke&mdash;"I am
Nelly."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes again.</p>

<p>"Little Nell," he said, "has she sent you down
to me from heaven? My little Nell!"</p>

<p>And then he fell back unconscious&mdash;this time
he had fainted.</p>

<p>She thought he was dead, but it was not so&mdash;her
cries for help soon brought her friends, Mr.
Raynald first of all. He did not seem startled, he
soothed Ellinor at once.</p>

<p>"It is poor old Giles," he said. "I know all
about him, he has found his way in at last."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>," stammered the girl, "there
is something else, Mr. Raynald. I&mdash;I seem to
remember something."</p>

<p>She looked nearly as white as their poor visitor,
and as Mr. Raynald glanced at her, a curious
expression flitted across his own face.</p>

<p>Could it be so? He knew all her story.</p>

<p>"Wait a little, my dear," he said. "We must
attend to poor Giles first."</p>

<p>They were very kind and tender to the old
man, but he seemed to be barely conscious, even
after restoratives had brought him out of the
actual fainting fit. Then Mrs. Raynald proposed
that his servants&mdash;his housekeeper if he had one&mdash;should
be sent for.</p>

<p>And when faithful Betsy, stout as of old, though
less nimble, made her appearance, her irrepressible
emotion at the sight of Ellinor, pale and trembling
though the young governess was, gave form and
substance to Mr. Raynald's suspicions.</p>

<p>Yes, they had met at last&mdash;father and daughter&mdash;"half-way
between the stiles". He was
"Dada," she was little "Nell". Might it not be
that Marion's prayers had brought them together?</p>

<p>Every reasonable proof was forthcoming&mdash;the
little parcel of clothes, the correspondence in the
dates, the strong resemblance to her mother.</p>

<p>And&mdash;joy does not often kill. Barnett was able
to understand it all better than might have been
expected. He was never <i>quite</i> himself, but infinitely
better both in mind and body than poor old
Betsy had ever dreamt of seeing him. And he
was perfectly content&mdash;content to live as long as
it should please God to spare him to his little
Nell; ready to go to his Marion when the time
should come.</p>

<p>And Ellinor had her wish&mdash;a home, though not
a "grand" one; some one of her "very own" to
care for; a father's devoted love, and, to complete
her happiness, the friends who had grown so dear
to her close at hand.</p>

<p>More may yet be hers in the future, for she is
still young. Her father may live to see his grandchildren
playing about the farmstead at Mayling,
so that, though the name be changed, the old
stock will still nourish where so many generations
of its ancestors have sown and reaped.</p>

<h3><a name="st_IV" id="st_IV"></a>AT THE DIP OF THE ROAD.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Have I ever seen a ghost?</p>

<p>I do not know.</p>

<p>That is the only reply I can truthfully make to
the question now-a-days so often asked. And
sometimes, if inquirers care to hear more, I go on
to tell them the one experience which makes it impossible
for me to reply positively either in the
affirmative or negative, and restricts me to "I do
not know".</p>

<p>This was the story.</p>

<p>I was staying with relations in the country.
Not a very isolated or out-of-the-way part of the
world, and yet rather inconvenient of access by
the railway. For the nearest station was six miles
off. Though the family I was visiting were
nearly connected with me I did not know much of
their home or its neighbourhood, as the head of
the house, an uncle of mine by marriage, had only
come into the property a year or two previously
to the date of which I am writing, through the
death of an elder brother.</p>

<p>It was a nice place. A good comfortable old
house, a prosperous, satisfactory estate. Everything
about it was in good order, from the
farmers, who always paid their rents, to the
shooting, which was always good; from the
vineries, which were noted, to the woods, where
the earliest primroses in all the country side
were yearly to be found.</p>

<p>And my uncle and aunt and their family deserved
these pleasant things and made a good
use of them.</p>

<p>But there was a touch of the commonplace
about it all. There was nothing picturesque or
romantic. The country was flat though fertile,
the house, though old, was conveniently modern
in its arrangements, airy, cheery, and bright.</p>

<p>"Not even a ghost, or the shadow of one," I
remember saying one day with a faint grumble.</p>

<p>"Ah, well&mdash;as to that," said my uncle, "perhaps
we<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" but just then something interrupted
him, and I forgot his unfinished speech.</p>

<p>Into the happy party of which for the time
being I was one, there fell one morning a sudden
thunderbolt of calamity. The post brought news
of the alarming illness of the eldest daughter&mdash;Frances,
married a year or two ago and living,
as the crow flies, at no very great distance. But
as the crow flies is not always as the railroad runs,
and to reach the Aldoyns' home from Fawne
Court, my uncle's place, was a complicated business&mdash;it
was scarcely possible to go and return in a day.</p>

<p>"Can one of you come over?" wrote the
young husband. "She is already out of danger,
but longing to see her mother or one of you. She
is worrying about the baby"&mdash;a child of a few
months old&mdash;"and wishing for nurse."</p>

<p>We looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Nurse must go at once," said my uncle to me,
as the eldest of the party. Perhaps I should here
say that I am a widow, though not old, and with
no close ties or responsibilities. "But for your
aunt it is impossible."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I agreed. For she was at the
moment painfully lamed by rheumatism.</p>

<p>"And the other girls are almost too young at
such a crisis," my uncle continued. "Would you,
Charlotte<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" and he hesitated. "It would be
such a comfort to have personal news of her."</p>

<p>"Of course I will go," I said. "Nurse and I
can start at once. I will leave her there, and return
alone, to give you, I have no doubt, better
news of poor Francie."</p>

<p>He was full of gratitude. So were they all.</p>

<p>"Don't hurry back to-night," said my uncle.
"Stay till&mdash;till Monday if you like." But I could
not promise. I knew they would be glad of news
at once, and in a small house like my cousin's, at
such a time, an inmate the more might be inconvenient.</p>

<p>"I will try to return to-night," I said. And as I
sprang into the carriage I added: "Send to Moore
to meet the last train, unless I telegraph to the
contrary."</p>

<p>My uncle nodded; the boys called after me,
"All right;" the old butler bowed assent, and I
was satisfied.</p>

<p>Nurse and I reached our journey's end promptly,
considering the four or five junctions at which we
had to change carriages. But on the whole "going,"
the trains fitted astonishingly.</p>

<p>We found Frances better, delighted to see us,
eager for news of her mother, and, finally, disposed
to sleep peacefully now that she knew that there
was an experienced person in charge. And both
she and her husband thanked me so much that I
felt ashamed of the little I had done. Mr. Aldoyn
begged me to stay till Monday; but the house
was upset, and I was eager to carry back my good
tidings.</p>

<p>"They are meeting me at Moore by the last
train," I said. "No, thank you, I think it is best
to go."</p>

<p>"You will have an uncomfortable journey," he
replied. "It is Saturday, and the trains will be
late, and the stations crowded with the market
people. It will be horrid for you, Charlotte."</p>

<p>But I persisted.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> rather horrid. And it was queer. There
was a sort of uncanny eeriness about that Saturday
evening's journey that I have never forgotten. The
season was very early spring. It was not very cold,
but chilly and ungenial. And there were such odd
sorts of people about. I travelled second-class; for
I am not rich, and I am very independent. I did
not want my uncle to pay my fare, for I liked the
feeling of rendering him some small service in return
for his steady kindness to me. The first stage
of my journey was performed in the company of
two old naturalists travelling to Scotland to look
for some small plant which was to be found only
in one spot in the Highlands. This I gathered
from their talk to each other. You never saw two
such extraordinary creatures as they were. They
both wore black kid gloves much too large for
them, and the ends of the fingers waved about like
feathers.</p>

<p>Then followed two or three short transits, interspersed
with weary waitings at stations. The last
of these was the worst, and tantalising, too, for by
this time I was within a few miles of Moore. The
station was crowded with rough folk, all, it seemed
to me, more or less tipsy. So I took refuge in a
dark waiting-room on the small side line by which
I was to proceed, where I felt I might have been
robbed and murdered and no one the wiser.</p>

<p>But at last came my slow little train, and in I
jumped, to jump out again still more joyfully
some fifteen minutes later when we drew up at
Moore.</p>

<p>I peered about for the carriage. It was not to
be seen; only two or three tax-carts or dog-carts,
farmers' vehicles, standing about, while their
owners, it was easy to hear, were drinking far
more than was good for them in the taproom of
the Unicorn. Thence, nevertheless&mdash;not to the
taproom, but to the front of the inn&mdash;I made my
way, though not undismayed by the shouts and
roars breaking the stillness of the quiet night.
"Was the Fawne Court carriage not here?" I
asked.</p>

<p>The landlady was a good-natured woman, especially
civil to any member of the "Court" family.
But she shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, no carriage had been down to-day. There
must have been some mistake."</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to wait till she
could somehow or other disinter a fly and a horse,
and, worst of all a driver. For the "men" she
had to call were all rather&mdash;"well, ma'am, you see
it's Saturday night. We weren't expecting any
one."</p>

<p>And when, after waiting half an hour, the fly at
last emerged, my heart almost failed me. Even
before he drove out of the yard, it was very plain
that if ever we reached Fawne Court alive, it
would certainly be more thanks to good luck than
to the driver's management.</p>

<p>But the horse was old and the man had a sort of
instinct about him. We got on all right till we
were more than half way to our journey's end.
The road was straight and the moonlight bright,
especially after we had passed a certain corner,
and got well out of the shade of the trees which
skirted the first part of the way.</p>

<p>Just past this turn there came a dip in the road.
It went down, down gradually, for a quarter of a
mile or more, and I looked up anxiously, fearful of
the horse taking advantage of the slope. But no,
he jogged on, if possible more slowly than before,
though new terrors assailed me when I saw that the
driver was now fast asleep, his head swaying from
side to side with extraordinary regularity. After a
bit I grew easier again; he seemed to keep his
equilibrium, and I looked out at the side window
on the moon-flooded landscape, with some interest.
I had never seen brighter moonlight.</p>

<p>Suddenly from out of the intense stillness and
loneliness a figure, a human figure, became visible.
It was that of a man, a young and active man,
running along the footpath a few feet to our left,
apparently from some whim, keeping pace with the
fly. My first feeling was of satisfaction that I was
no longer alone, at the tender mercies of my stupefied
charioteer. But, as I gazed, a slight misgiving
came over me. Who could it be running along this
lonely road so late, and what was his motive in
keeping up with us so steadily. It almost seemed
as if he had been waiting for us, yet that, of course,
was impossible. He was not very highwayman-like
certainly; he was well-dressed&mdash;neatly-dressed that
is to say, like a superior gamekeeper&mdash;his figure was
remarkably good, tall and slight, and he ran gracefully.
But there was something queer about him,
and suddenly the curiosity that had mingled in my
observation of him was entirely submerged in alarm,
when I saw that, as he ran, he was slowly but steadily
drawing nearer and nearer to the fly.</p>

<p>"In another moment he will be opening the door
and jumping in," I thought, and I glanced before
me only to see that the driver was more hopelessly
asleep than before; there was no chance of his
hearing if I called out. And get out I could not
without attracting the strange runner's attention,
for as ill-luck would have it, the window was drawn
up on the right side, and I could not open the door
without rattling the glass. While, worse and worse,
the left hand window was down! Even that slight
protection wanting!</p>

<p>I looked out once more. By this time the figure
was close, close to the fly. Then an arm was
stretched out and laid along the edge of the door,
as if preparatory to opening it, and then, for the first
time I saw his face. It was a young face, but
terribly, horribly pale and ghastly, and the eyes&mdash;all
was so visible in the moonlight&mdash;had an expression
such as I had never seen before or since. It
terrified me, though afterwards on recalling it, it
seemed to me that it might have been more a
look of agonised appeal than of menace of any
kind.</p>

<p>I cowered back into my corner and shut my
eyes, feigning sleep. It was the only idea that
occurred to me. My heart was beating like a
sledge hammer. All sorts of thoughts rushed
through me; among them I remember saying
to myself: "He must be an escaped lunatic&mdash;his
eyes are so awfully wild".</p>

<p>How long I sat thus I don't know&mdash;whenever I
dared to glance out furtively he was still there.
But all at once a strange feeling of relief came
over me. I sat up&mdash;yes, he was gone! And
though, as I took courage, I leant out and looked
round in every direction, not a trace of him was
to be seen, though the road and the fields were
bare and clear for a long distance round.</p>

<p>When I got to Fawne Court I had to wake
the lodge-keeper&mdash;every one was asleep. But my
uncle was still up, though not expecting me, and
very distressed he was at the mistake about the
carriage.</p>

<p>"However," he concluded, "all's well that ends
well. It's delightful to have your good news.
But you look sadly pale and tired, Charlotte."</p>

<p>Then I told him of my fright&mdash;it seemed now
so foolish of me, I said. But my uncle did not
smile&mdash;on the contrary.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said. "It sounds very like our
ghost, though, of course, it may have been only
one of the keepers."</p>

<p>He told me the story. Many years ago in his
grandfather's time, a young and favourite gamekeeper
had been found dead in a field skirting the
road down there. There was no sign of violence
upon the body; it was never explained what had
killed him. But he had had in his charge a
watch&mdash;a very valuable one&mdash;which his master for
some reason or other had handed to him to take
home to the house, not wishing to keep it on him.
And when the body was found late that night, the
watch was not on it. Since then, so the story goes,
on a moonlight night the spirit of the poor fellow
haunts the spot. It is supposed that he wants to
tell what had become of his master's watch, which
was never found. But no one has ever had courage
to address him.</p>

<p>"He never comes farther than the dip in the
road," said my uncle. "If you had spoken to
him, Charlotte, I wonder if he would have told
you his secret?"</p>

<p>He spoke half laughingly, but I have never
quite forgiven myself for my cowardice. It was
the look in those eyes!</p>

<p>"'Lingard,' 'Trevannion,'" murmured Captain
Murray, as he ran his eye down the column of
the morning paper specially devoted to so-called
fashionable intelligence, "Lingard, Arthur Lingard;
yes, I've met him; a very good fellow.

Trevannion, Bessie?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Murray glanced up from her teacups.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Walter? Trevannion;
yes, I have met a girl of the name at my aunt's.
A pretty girl, and I think I heard she was going
to be married. Is that what you are talking
about?"</p>

<p>"No," her husband replied. "It's the other
way&mdash;broken off, I wonder why."</p>

<p>"What an old gossip you are," said Mrs.
Murray. "No good reason at all, I daresay.
People are so capricious now-a-days."</p>

<p>"Still, they don't often announce a marriage
till it's pretty certain to come off. This sort of
thing," tapping the paper as he spoke, "isn't
exactly pleasant."</p>

<p>"Very much the reverse," agreed Mrs. Murray,
and then they thought no more about it.</p>

<p>"I wonder why," said a good many people
that morning, when they caught sight of the
announcement. For the two principals it concerned&mdash;Arthur
Lingard, especially&mdash;had a large
circle of friends and acquaintances, and their
engagement had been the subject of much and
hearty congratulation. It seemed so natural and
fitting that these two should marry. Both young,
amiable, good-looking, and sufficiently well off.
Even the most cynical could discern no cloud in
the bright sky of their future, no crook in the
lot before them.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;</p>

<p>No marvel that Captain Murray's soliloquy
was repeated by many.</p>

<p>But who would have guessed that in one heart
it was ever ringing with maddening anguish?</p>

<p>"I wonder why, oh, I wonder why he has done
it. Oh, if he would but tell me, it could not
surely seem quite so unendurable."</p>

<p>And Daisy Trevannion pressed her aching head,
and her poor swollen eyes on to her mother's loving
bosom in a sort of wild despair.</p>

<p>"Mamma, mamma," she cried, "help me. I
cannot be angry with him. I wish I could. He
was so gentle, so sweet&mdash;and he is so heartbroken,
I can see by his letter. Oh, mamma, what can it
be?"</p>

<p>But to this, even the devoted mother, who would
gladly have given her own life to save her child
this misery, could find no answer.</p>

<p>This was what had happened.</p>

<p>They had been engaged about three months, the
wedding day was approximately fixed, when one
morning the blow fell.</p>

<p>A letter to Daisy's father, enclosing one to herself&mdash;a
letter which made Mr. Trevannion draw
his brows together in instinctive indignation, and
then as the first impulse cooled a little, caused him
to turn to his daughter with a movement of irritation,
underneath which, hope had, nevertheless,
found time to reassert itself.</p>

<p>"Daisy," he exclaimed sharply, "what is the
meaning of all this nonsense? Have you been
quarrelling with Lingard? You're a bit of a
spoilt child I know, my dear, but I don't like
playing with edged tools&mdash;a man like Arthur
won't stand being trifled with. Do you hear,
Daisy&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>For the girl had scarcely caught the sense of his
words, so absorbed was she in those of the short,
all too short, but terrible letter she had just read&mdash;the
letter addressed to herself, which began "Daisy,
my Daisy, for the last time," and ended abruptly
with the simple signature, "Arthur Lingard".</p>

<p>She gazed up at her father&mdash;her white face all
drawn, and as it were, withered with that minute's
agony&mdash;her eyes dulled and yet wild. Never was
there such a metamorphosis from the happy, laughing
girl who had hurried in with some pretty excuse
for her unpunctuality.</p>

<p>"Daisy, my child! Daisy," her father repeated,
repenting already of his hasty remarks, "don't
take it so seriously. Margaret," to his wife,
"speak to her."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Trevannion, as pale almost as her
daughter, drew the sheet of note-paper from the
girl's unresisting hands, while her husband held
out to her his own letter.</p>

<p>"Some complete mistake," she said, "some
misplaced quixotry. Daisy, my own darling, do
not take it so seriously. Your father will see him&mdash;you
will, will you not, Hugh?" detecting the
proud hesitation in her husband's face. "It is not
as if we did not know him well, and all about him.
Your father will find out, Daisy, and make it all
right."</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion did not contradict her, but
murmured some consolatory words, and then the
mother led Daisy away, and to a certain extent the
girl allowed herself to be reassured.</p>

<p>"I will consult Keir if necessary," said the
father when out of hearing of his daughter. "He
is the natural person, both as our own connection
and because he introduced Lingard, and thinks
so highly of him. But first I will see Arthur
alone. The fewer mixed up in such a case the
better."</p>

<p>Mrs. Trevannion agreed. She was constitutionally
sanguine, but a painful idea struck her as her
husband spoke.</p>

<p>"Hugh," she said hesitatingly, "you don't
think&mdash;it surely is not possible that his&mdash;that
Arthur's brain is affected?"</p>

<p>"His brain&mdash;tut, nonsense! What a woman's
idea!" replied Mr. Trevannion irritably. "Why,
he is receiving compliments on every side, from the
very highest quarters, too, on that article of his on
the Capricorn Islands. Brain affected, indeed!"</p>

<p>And to a whisper of, "I was thinking of over-work,"
which followed him apologetically, he
vouchsafed no reply.</p>

<p>Some intensely trying days passed. Mr. Trevannion's
interview with his recalcitrant son-in-law-to-be,
proved a complete failure. Nothing, absolutely
nothing was to be "got out of the fellow,"
he told his wife in mingled anger and wretchedness,
for the poor man was a devoted father. Arthur was
gentleness itself, respectful, deferential even, to the
man whose peculiarly disagreeable position he felt
for inexpressibly. But he was as firm, as hard in
his decision that all should be, must be, over between
Miss Trevannion and himself, as if his own heart
had suddenly turned to iron, as if he possessed no
feelings at all. He grew white to the lips, with a
terrible death-like whiteness, when he named her;
he said with a quiet, deliberate emphasis, more
impressive by far than any passionate declaration,
that never, never while he lived, would he forgive
himself for the trouble he had brought into her
young life, but that he was powerless to do otherwise,
he was absolutely without a choice. As to the
reason for the breaking off of the engagement to
be given to the world, he left it entirely in the
Trevannions' own hands; he would contradict nothing
they thought it best to say; but, if possible,
he grew still whiter when his visitor from under
his shaggy eyebrows glanced at him with a look of
contempt while he replied cuttingly that he had
no love of falsehood. For his part he would tell
the truth, and in the end he believed it would be
best for Daisy that all the world should know the
way in which she had been treated.</p>

<p>"Best for her and worst for you," he repeated.</p>

<p>And Arthur only said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope so. It must be as you think well."</p>

<p>Then Trevannion softened again a little.</p>

<p>"I shall say nothing to any one at present," he
went on. "I must see Keir; possibly he may
understand you better than I can."</p>

<p>But, "No, it will be no use," the young man
repeated coldly, though his very heart was wrung
for the father, crushing down his own pride while
he thought he saw still the ghost of a hope. "It
will be no use. No one can do anything."</p>

<p>"And you adhere to your determination not to
see my&mdash;not to see Daisy again?"</p>

<p>Lingard bowed his head.</p>

<p>And Mr. Trevannion left him.</p>

<p>Philip Keir was no blood relation of the Trevannions,
but a cousin by marriage and a very
intimate friend. He was some years older than
Mr. Lingard, and it was through him that the
acquaintance resulting in Daisy's engagement had
begun. He was a reserved man, with a frank
and cordial manner. Daisy thought she knew
him well, but as to this she was in some directions
entirely mistaken.</p>

<p>He was away from home when Mr. Trevannion
called on him, driving straight to his chambers
from the fruitless interview with Lingard. Philip
did not return for a couple of days, and had left
no address. Hence ensued the painful interval
of suspense alluded to.</p>

<p>But on the third evening a hansom dashed up
to the Trevannions' door, and Mr. Keir jumped
out. It was late, but there was no hesitation as
to admitting him.</p>

<p>"I found your note," he said, as he grasped
his host's hand, "and came straight on. I have
only just got back. What is the matter? Tell
me at once."</p>

<p>He was a self-controlled man, but his agitation
was evident. "Daisy?" he added hastily.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the father. The two were alone
in his study. "Poor Daisy!" And then he
told the story.</p>

<p>Keir listened, though not altogether in silence,
for broken exclamations, which he seemed unable
to repress, broke out from him more than once.</p>

<p>"Impossible&mdash;-inconceivable!" he muttered,
"Lingard, of all men, to behave like a<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" he
stopped short, at a loss for a comparison.</p>

<p>"Then you can throw no light upon it&mdash;none
whatever?" said Mr. Trevannion. "We had
hoped&mdash;foolishly, perhaps&mdash;I had somehow hoped
that you might have helped us. You know him
well, you see, you have been so much together,
your acquaintance is of old date, and you must
understand any peculiarities of his character."</p>

<p>His tone still sounded as if he could not bring
himself finally to accept the position. Keir was
inexpressibly sorry for him.</p>

<p>"I know of none," he said. "Frankly, I
know of nothing about him that is not estimable.
And, as you say, we have been much and most
intimately associated. We have travelled together
half over the world, we have been dependent on
each other for months at a time, and the more I
have seen of him the more I have admired and&mdash;yes&mdash;loved
him. If I had to pick a fault in him
I would say it is a curious spice of obstinacy&mdash;I
have seen it very strongly now and then. Once,"
and his face grew grave, "once, we nearly
quarrelled because he would not give in on a
certain point. It was in Siberia, not long ago,"
and here Philip gave a sort of shiver, "it was
very horrible&mdash;no need to go into details. He,
Arthur, got it into his head that a particular course
of action was called for, and there was no moving
him. However it ended all right. I had almost
forgotten it. But he was determined."</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion listened, but vaguely. Keir's
remarks scarcely seemed to the point.</p>

<p>"Obstinate!" he repeated. "Yes, but that
doesn't explain things. There was no question
of giving in. They had had no quarrel. Daisy
was perfectly happy. The only thing she can say
on looking back over the last week or two closely,
is that Arthur had seemed depressed now and
then, and when she taxed him with it he evaded
a reply. You don't think, Philip, that there is
anything of that kind&mdash;melancholia, you know&mdash;in
his family?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, no, my dear sir. He comes of the
healthiest stock possible. People one knows all
about for generations. No, no, it's nothing of
that kind," Keir replied. "And&mdash;what man ever
had such happy prospects?"</p>

<p>"Then what in heaven's name is it?" said Mr.
Trevannion, bringing his hand down violently on
the table beside which they were sitting. "Can
you get it out of him, if you can do nothing else
for us, Philip? It is our right to know; it is&mdash;it
is due to my child, it is<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" he stopped, his
face working with emotion. "He won't see her,
you know," he added disconnectedly.</p>

<p>"I will try," said Philip. "It is indeed the
least I can do. If&mdash;if I could get him to see
her&mdash;Daisy; surely that would be the best
chance."</p>

<p>Mr. Trevannion looked at him sharply, scrutinisingly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are satisfied then&mdash;entirely satisfied
that there is nothing we need dread her being
mixed up in, so to say? Nothing wrong&mdash;nothing
to shock a girl like her? You see," half apologetically,
"his refusing to see her makes one
afraid<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"I am as sure of him as of myself&mdash;surer," said
Philip earnestly. "There is nothing in his past
to explain it&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"An early secret marriage; a wife he thought
dead turning up again," suggested the father. "It
sounds absurd, sensational&mdash;but after all&mdash;there
must be some reason."</p>

<p>"Not that," said Keir, getting up as he spoke.
"Well then, I will see him first thing in the morning,
and communicate with you as soon as possible
after I have done so. You will tell Mrs.
Trevannion and&mdash;and Daisy that I will do my
best?"</p>

<p>"My wife is still in the drawing-room. Will
you not see her to-night?"</p>

<p>Philip shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is late," he said, "and I am dusty and unpresentable.
Besides, there is really nothing to say.
To-morrow it shall be as you all think best. I will
see Mrs. Trevannion&mdash;and Daisy," here he flushed
a little, but his host did not observe it, "if you like
and if she wishes it. Heaven send I may have
better news than I expect."</p>

<p>And with a warm pressure of his old friend's
hand, Mr. Keir left him.</p>

<p>The two younger men met the next morning.
There was no difficulty about it, for Lingard, knowing
by instinct that the interview must take place,
had determined to face it. So of the two he was
the more prepared, the more forearmed.</p>

<p>The conversation was long&mdash;an hour, two hours
passed before poor Philip could make up his mind
to accept the ultimatum contained in the few hard
words with which Arthur Lingard first greeted him.</p>

<p>"I know what you have come about. I knew
you must come. You could not help yourself. But,
Philip, it will save you pain&mdash;I don't mind for myself;
nothing can matter now&mdash;if you will at once
take my word for it that nothing you can say will
do the least shadow of good. No, don't shake hands
with me. I would rather you didn't."</p>

<p>And he put his right arm behind his back and
stood there, leaning against the mantelpiece, facing
his friend.</p>

<p>Philip looked up at him grimly.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I've given my word to&mdash;to
these poor dear people, and I'll stick to it. You've
got to make up your mind to a cross-examination,
Lingard."</p>

<p>But through or below the grimness was a terrible
pity. Philip's heart was very tender for the man
whose inexplicable conduct was yet filling him with
indignation past words. Arthur was so changed&mdash;the
last week or two had done the work of years&mdash;all
the youthfulness, the almost boyish brightness,
which had been one of his charms, was gone,
dead. He was pale with a strange indescribable
pallor, that told of days, and worse still, of nights
of agony; the lines of his face were hardened; the
lips spoke of unalterable determination. Only once
had Philip seen him look thus, and then it was but
in expression&mdash;the likeness and the contrast struck
him curiously. The other time it had been resolution
temporarily hardening a youthful face; now&mdash;what
did it remind him of? A monk who had
gone through a life-time of spiritual struggle alone,
unaided by human sympathy? A martyr&mdash;no,
there was no enthusiasm. It was all dull, dead
anguish of unalterable resolve.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Keir was
choking down an uncomfortable something in his
throat, and bracing himself to the inquisitorial
torture before him to perform.</p>

<p>"Well," said Arthur, at last.</p>

<p>And Philip looked up at him again.</p>

<p>How queer his eyes were&mdash;they used to be so
deeply blue. Daisy had often laughed at his
changeable eyes, as she called them&mdash;blue in the
daytime, almost black at night, but always lustrous
and liquid. Now, they were glassy, almost filmy.
What was it? A sudden thought struck Philip.</p>

<p>"Arthur!" he exclaimed, "Arthur, old fellow,
are you going blind? Is that the mystery? If
it is that, good Lord, how little you know her,
if you think that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>Arthur's pale lips grew visibly paler. He had
been unprepared for attack in this direction, and
for the moment he quailed before it.</p>

<p>"No," he whispered hoarsely, "it is not that.
Would to God it were!"</p>

<p>But almost instantly he had mastered himself,
and from that moment throughout the interview
not even the mention of Daisy's name had power
to stir him.</p>

<p>And Philip, annoyed with his own impulsiveness,
stiffened again.</p>

<p>"You are determined not to reveal your
secret," he began, "but I want to come to an
understanding with you on one point. If I guess
it, if I put my finger on it, will you give me
the satisfaction of owning that I have done so."</p>

<p>Lingard hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I will do so on one condition&mdash;your
word of honour, your oath, never to tell
it to any human being."</p>

<p>"Not to&mdash;her&mdash;Daisy?"</p>

<p>"Least of all."</p>

<p>Philip groaned. This did not look very promising
for the meeting with Daisy, which at the
bottom of his heart he believed in as his last&mdash;his
trump card.</p>

<p>Still, he had gained something.</p>

<p>"Then, my first question seems, in the face of
that, almost a mockery. I was going to ask
you," and he half gasped&mdash;"it is nothing&mdash;nothing
about her that is at the root of all this
misery? No fancy," again the gasp, "that&mdash;that
she doesn't care for you, or love you enough?
No nonsense about your not being suited to each
other, or that you couldn't make a girl of her
sensitive, high-strung nature happy?"</p>

<p>"No," said Arthur, and the word seemed to
ring through the room. "No, I know she loves
me as I love her. Oh, no, not quite like that, I
trust," and his voice was firm through all the tragedy
of the last sentence. "And I believe I could have
made her very happy. Leave her name out of it
now, Phil, once for all. It has nothing to do
personally with the woman who is, and always
will be, to me my perfect ideal of sweetness and
excellence and truth and beauty."</p>

<p>"Then it has to do with yourself," murmured
Keir. "Come, the radius is narrowing. I flew
out at poor Trevannion when he suggested it, but
all the same, it's nothing in your past you're
ashamed of that's come to light, is it? The best
fellows in the world make fools of themselves
sometimes, you know. Don't mind my asking."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Arthur wearily, "but it's
no use. No, it's nothing like that. I have done
nothing I am ashamed of. I am not secretly
married, nor have I committed forgery," with a
very ghastly attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>"Then," said Philip, "is it something about
your family. Have you found out that there's a
strain of insanity in the Lingards perhaps? People
exaggerate that kind of thing now-a-days. There's
a touch of it in us all, I take it."</p>

<p>"No," said Arthur, again "my family's all
right. I've no very near relations except my
sister, but you know her, and you know all about
us. We're not adventurers in any sense of the
word."</p>

<p>"Far from it," agreed Philip warmly. Then
for a moment or two he relapsed into silence.
"Does your sister&mdash;does Lady West know about&mdash;about
this mysterious affair?" he asked abruptly,
after some pondering.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever. I, of course, was bound
by every consideration not to tell her&mdash;to tell no
one anything till it was understood by&mdash;the
Trevannions. And I had no reason for consulting
her or&mdash;any friend," Arthur replied.</p>

<p>He spoke jerkily and with effort, as if he were
putting force on himself to endure what yet he was
convinced was absolutely useless torture.</p>

<p>But his words gave Keir a new opening, which
he was quick to seize.</p>

<p>"That's just it," he exclaimed eagerly. "That's
just where it strikes me you've gone wrong. You
should have consulted some one&mdash;not myself, not
your sister even; I don't say whom, but some one
sensible and trustworthy. I believe your mind has
got warped. You've been thinking over this
trouble, whatever it is, till you can't see it rightly.
You've exaggerated it out of all proportion, and
you shouldn't trust your own morbid judgment."</p>

<p>Lingard did not answer. He stood motionless,
his eyes fixed upon the ground. For an instant
a wild hope dashed through Philip that at last he
had made some impression. But as Arthur slowly
raised his dim, worn eyes, and looked him in the
face, it faded again, even before the young man
spoke.</p>

<p>"To satisfy you, I will tell you this much. I
have consulted one person&mdash;a man whom you
would allow was trustworthy and wise and good.
From him I have hidden nothing whatever, and
he agrees with me that I have no choice&mdash;that duty
points unmistakably to the course I am pursuing."</p>

<p>Again a flash of suggestion struck his hearer.</p>

<p>"One person&mdash;a man," he repeated. "Arthur,
is it some priest? Have they been converting or
perverting you, my boy? Are you going over to
Rome, fancying yourself called to be a Trappist,
or a&mdash;those fellows at the Grande Chartreuse, you
remember?"</p>

<p>For the second time during the interview, Arthur
smiled, and his smile was a trifle less ghastly this
time.</p>

<p>"No, again," he said. "You're quite on a
wrong tack. I have not the slightest inclination
that way. I&mdash;I wish I had. No, my adviser is no
priest. But he's one of the best of men, all the
same, and one of the wisest."</p>

<p>"You won't tell me who he is?"</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"And"&mdash;Philip was reluctant to try his last
hope, and felt conscious that he would do it clumsily&mdash;"Arthur,"
he burst out, "you will see her&mdash;Daisy&mdash;once
more? She has a right to it. You
are putting enough upon her without refusing this
one request of hers."</p>

<p>He stood up as he spoke. He himself had
grown strangely pale, and seeing this, as he glanced
at him, Lingard's own face became ashen.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he said, "I think this might
have been spared me. No, I will not see her
again. The only thing I can do for her is to
refuse this last request. Tell her so, Philip&mdash;tell
her what I say. And now leave me. Don't shake
hands with me. I don't wish it, and I daresay you
don't. If&mdash;if we never meet again, you and I&mdash;and
who knows?&mdash;if this is our goodbye, thank
you, old fellow, thank you for all you have tried to
do. Perhaps I know the cost of it to you better
than you imagine. Good-bye, Phil!"</p>

<p>Keir turned towards the door. But he looked
back ere he reached it. Arthur was standing as he
had been&mdash;motionless.</p>

<p>"You're not thinking of killing yourself, are
you?" he said quietly.</p>

<p>Arthur looked at him. His eyes had a different
expression now&mdash;or was it that something was
gleaming softly in them that had not been there
before?</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I am not going to be false to my
colours. I&mdash;I don't care to talk much about it,
but&mdash;I am a Christian, Phil."</p>

<p>"At least I can put that horrid idea out of the
poor child's head, then," thought Keir to himself.
Though to Arthur he did not reply, save by a bend
of his head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time passed. And in his wings there was
healing.</p>

<p>At twenty-four, Daisy Trevannion, though her
face bore traces of suffering of no common order,
was yet a sweet and serene woman. To some
extent she had outlived the strange tragedy of her
earlier girlhood.</p>

<p>It had never been explained. The one person
who might naturally have been looked to, to
throw some light on the mystery, Lingard's
sister, Lady West, was, as her brother had
stated, completely in the dark. At first she had
been disposed to blame Daisy, or her family;
and though afterwards convinced that in so
doing she was entirely mistaken, she never became
in any sense confidential with them on the matter.
And after a few months they met no more. For
her husband was sent abroad, and detained there
on an important diplomatic mission.</p>

<p>Now and then, in the earlier days of her broken
engagement, Daisy would ask Philip to "try to
find out if Mary West knows where he is".
And to please her he did so. But all he learnt
was&mdash;what indeed was all the sister had to tell&mdash;that
Arthur was off again on his old travels&mdash;to
the Capricorn Islands or to the moon, it was
not clear which.</p>

<p>"He has promised that I shall hear from him
once a year&mdash;as near my birthday as he can
manage. That is all I can tell you," she said,
trying to make light of it.</p>

<p>And whether this promise was kept or no, one
thing was certain&mdash;Arthur Lingard had entirely
disappeared from London society.</p>

<p>At twenty-five, Daisy married Philip. He
had always loved her, though he had never
allowed her to suspect it; and knowing herself
and her history as he did, he was satisfied with
the true affection she could give him&mdash;satisfied,
that is to say, in the hope and belief that his own
devotion would kindle ever-increasing response
on her side. And his hopes were not disappointed.
They were very happy.</p>

<p>Now for the sequel to the story&mdash;such sequel,
that is to say, as there is to give&mdash;a suggestion
of explanation rather than any positive <i>d&eacute;noument</i>
of the mystery.</p>

<p>They&mdash;Philip and Daisy&mdash;had been married
for two or three years when one evening it
chanced to them to dine at the house of a rather
well-known literary man with whom they were
but slightly acquainted. They had been invited
for a special reason; their hosts were pleasant
and genial people who liked to get those about
them with interests in common. And Keir,
though his wings were now so happily clipt, still
held his position as a traveller who had seen and
noted much in his former wanderings.</p>

<p>"We think your husband may enjoy a talk
with Sir Abel Maynard, who is with us for a
few days," Mrs. Thorncroft had said in her
note.</p>

<p>And Sir Abel, not being of the surly order of
lions who refuse to roar when they know that
their audience is eager to hear them, made himself
most agreeable. He appreciated Mr. Keir's intelligence
and sympathy, and was by no means indifferent
to Mrs. Keir's beauty, though "evidently," he
thought to himself, "she is not over fond of
reminiscences of her husband's travels. Perhaps
she is afraid of his taking flight again."</p>

<p>During dinner the conversation turned, not
unnaturally, on a subject just at that moment
much to the fore. For it was about the time of
the heroic Damien's death.</p>

<p>"No," said Sir Abel, in answer to some inquiry,
"I never visited his place. But I have seen lepers&mdash;to
perfection. By-the-by," he went on suddenly,
"I came across a queer, a very queer, story a while
ago. I wonder, Keir, if you can throw any light
upon it?"</p>

<p>But at that moment Mrs. Thorncroft gave
the magic signal and the women left the
room.</p>

<p>By degrees the men came straggling upstairs
after them, then a little music followed, but it
was not till much later in the evening than was
usual with him that Philip made his appearance
in the drawing-room, preceded by Sir Abel
Maynard. Philip looked tired and rather "distrait,"
thought Daisy, whose eyes were keen with the
quick discernment of perfect affection, and she
was not sorry when, before very long, he whispered
to her that it was getting late, might they not leave
soon? Nor was she sorry that during the interval
before her husband made this suggestion, Sir Abel,
who had been devoting himself to her, had avoided
all mention of his travels, and had been amusing
her with his criticism of a popular novel instead.
She could never succeed altogether in banishing
the painful association of Arthur Lingard from
allusion to her husband's old wanderings.</p>

<p>Poor Arthur! Where was he now?</p>

<p>"Philip, dear," she said, slipping her hand into
his when they found themselves alone, and with a
longish drive before them, in their own little
brougham, "there is something the matter. You
have heard something? Tell me what it is."</p>

<p>Keir hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I suppose it is best to tell you.
It is the strange story Sir Abel alluded to before
you left the room."</p>

<p>"About&mdash;about Arthur? Is it about Arthur?"
whispered she, shivering a little.</p>

<p>Philip put his arm round her.</p>

<p>"I can't say. We shall perhaps never know
certainly," he replied. "But it looks very like it.
Listen, dear. Some little time ago&mdash;two or three
years ago&mdash;Maynard spent some days at one of
those awful leper settlements&mdash;never mind where.
I would just as soon you did not know. There,
to his amazement, among the most devoted of the
attendants upon the poor creatures he found an
Englishman, young still, at least by his own
account, though to judge by his appearance it
would have been impossible to say. For he was
himself far gone, very far gone in some ways, in
the disease. But he was, or had been, a man of
strong constitution and enormous determination.
Ill as he was, he yet managed to tend others with
indescribable devotion. They looked upon him
as a saint. Maynard did not like to inquire what
had brought him to such a pass&mdash;he, the poor
fellow, was a perfect gentleman. But the day
Sir Abel was leaving, the Englishman took him
to some extent into his confidence, and asked him
to do him a service. This was his story. Some
years before, in quite a different part of the world,
the young man had nursed a leper&mdash;a dying leper&mdash;for
some hours. He believed for long that he
had escaped all danger, in fact he never thought of
it; but it was not so. There must have been an
unhealed wound of some kind&mdash;a slight scratch
would do it&mdash;on his hand. No need to go into the
details of his first misgivings, of the horror of the
awful certainty at last. It came upon him in the
midst of the greatest happiness; he was going to
be married to a girl he adored."</p>

<p>"Oh, Philip, Philip, why did he not tell?"
Daisy wailed.</p>

<p>"He consulted the best and greatest physician,
who&mdash;as a friend, he said&mdash;approved of the course
he had mapped out for himself. He decided to
tell no one, to break off his engagement, and die
out of her&mdash;the girl's&mdash;life; not once, after he
was sure, did he see her again. He would not
even risk touching her hand. And he believed
that telling would only have brought worse agony
upon her in the end than the agony he was forced
to inflict. For he was a doomed man, though
they gave him a few years to live. And he did
the only thing he could do with those years. He
set off to the settlement in question. Maynard
was to call there some months later on his way
home, and the young man knew he would be dead
then, and so he was. But he showed Maynard a
letter explaining all, that he had got ready&mdash;all but
the address&mdash;<i>that</i>, he would not add till he was in
the act of dying. There must be no risk of
her knowing till he was dead. And this letter
Maynard was to fetch on his return. He did so,
but&mdash;there had been no time to add the address&mdash;death
had come suddenly. All sorts of precautions
had been ordered by the poor fellow as
to disinfecting the letter and so on. But it did
not seem to Maynard that these had been taken.
So he contented himself by spreading out the
paper on the sea-shore and learning it by heart,
and then leaving it. The sum total of it was
what I have told you, but not one name was
named."</p>

<p>Daisy was sobbing quietly.</p>

<p>"Was it he?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel sure of it," Philip replied. "For
I can supply the missing link. The one time I
really quarrelled with Arthur was when we were
in Siberia. He <i>would</i> spend a night in a dying
leper's hut. I would have done it myself, I
believe and hope, had it been necessary. But by
riding on a few miles we could have got help for
the poor creature&mdash;which indeed I did&mdash;and more
efficient help than ours. But Lingard was determined,
and no ill seemed to come of it. I had
almost forgotten the circumstance. I never associated
it with the mystery that caused you such
anguish, my poor darling."</p>

<p>"It was he," whispered Daisy. "Philip, he
was a hero after all."</p>

<p>"Not even you can feel that, as I do," Keir
replied.</p>

<p>Then they were silent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks afterwards came a letter from
Lady West, in her far-off South American home.
Daisy had not heard from her for years.</p>

<p>"By circuitous ways, I need not explain the
details," she wrote, "I have learnt that my darling
brother is dead. I thought I had better tell you.
I am sure his most earnest wish was that you
should live to be happy, dear Daisy, as I trust you
are. And I know you have long forgiven him
the sorrow he caused you&mdash;it was worse still for
him."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Daisy, "if she knows more?"</p>

<p>But the letter seemed to add certainty to their
own conviction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="st_VI" id="st_VI"></a>THE CLOCK THAT STRUCK THIRTEEN.</h3>

<p>"You misunderstand me wilfully, Helen. I
neither said nor inferred anything of the kind."</p>

<p>"What did you mean then, for if words to you
bear a different interpretation from what they do
to me, I must trouble you to speak in <i>my</i> language
when addressing me," angrily retorted a young
girl, with what nature had intended to be a very
pretty face with a charming expression, but which
at the present moment was far from deserving the
latter part of the description. Eyes flashing, cheeks
burning and hands clenched in the excess of her
indignation, stood Helen Beaumont by the window
of her pretty little sitting-room, or "studio" as
she loved to call it, presenting a striking contrast
to the peaceful scene without; where a carefully
tended garden still looked bright with the remaining
flowers of late September. Her companion,
standing in the attitude invariably assumed now-a-days
by novelists' heroes, namely, leaning against
the mantelpiece, was a young man of equally prepossessing
appearance with her own. At first
glance no one would have suspected him of
sharing any of the young lady's excitement, for
his expression was so calm as almost to merit
the description of sleepy. Looking more closely,
however, the signs of some unusual disturbance
or annoyance were to be descried, for his face was
slightly flushed and his blue eyes had lost the look
of sweet temper evidently their ordinary expression.</p>

<p>"What I meant to say, Helen, was not, as you
choose to misinterpret it, that I blame you for
proper womanly courage and spirit, than which, I
consider few things more admirable, nor as you
are well aware do I admire the sweetly silly and
affectedly timid order of young ladies. But this
I do mean and repeat, that I think your persistence
in this foolish scheme a piece of sheer bravado and
foolhardiness, totally unworthy of any sensible
person's approval, and what is more<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Malcolm, or rather Mr. Willoughby,
I have heard quite enough,"&mdash;and as she spoke,
Helen turned from the window out of which she
had been gazing while Malcolm spoke, with, it must
be confessed, very little interest in the varied tints
of the dahlias blooming in all their rich brilliance
on the terrace,&mdash;"I have heard quite enough, and
think myself exceedingly fortunate in having heard
it now before it is too late. You may imagine,"
she continued, "that I am speaking in temper,
but it is not so. I have for some time suspected,
and now feel convinced, that we are not suited to
each other. Your own words bear witness to your
opinion of me, 'self-willed, foolhardy, unwomanly,'
and I know not what other pretty expressions you
have applied to me, and for my part I tell you
simply that I cannot and will not marry a man
whose opinion of what a woman should be is like
yours; and who insults me constantly as you do,
by telling me how far short I fall of his ideal.
Marry your ideal, Malcolm Willoughby, and I shall
wish you joy of her. Some silly little fool who
dares not move a step alone in her bewitching
helplessness. But do not think to convert <i>me</i> into
such a piece of contemptible inanity," and so saying
she turned towards the door.</p>

<p>"Helen," said Malcolm quietly, so quietly that
Helen was arrested in spite of herself, "you are
unjust, unreasonable and ungenerous. You know
that I never cared for any woman but you, you
know that nothing pleases me more than to witness
your superiority in numberless particulars to the
general run of girls, and you know too the pride
and pleasure I take in your skill as an artist;
but blinded by self-will you will not see the
perfect reasonableness of my request that you
will abandon this absurd expedition. If not
for your own sake, at least do so for Edith's,
who is as you know left in your special charge by
Leonard."</p>

<p>The first part of this speech seemed, to judge
by Helen's transparent countenance, likely to
soften and move her, but the unlucky word
"absurd" and the tone in which Malcolm spoke,
as if it was necessary to remind her of her duty,
effectually did away with any good result that his
remonstrance might have worked. She turned,
with her hand on the door, and saying, "I have
told you my decision, Mr. Willoughby, and I
wish you good-evening," left the room. Malcolm
remained behind, lost in thought of no pleasurable
nature. At last he too left the little sitting-room,
after first ringing the bell and ordering his horse
to be brought round. Making his way to the
front entrance he there "mounted and rode away,"
his spirits, poor fellow, by no means the better for
his visit.</p>

<p>It is time, I think, to explain the cause of the
lovers' quarrel above described. Helen and Edith
Beaumont were orphans, left to the guardianship of
their brother Leonard, in whose house we have seen
the former. Delicacy, induced by a severe illness
some months previously, had obliged Mr. Beaumont,
accompanied by his wife, to go for the
autumn and winter months to the south of France,
leaving his sisters at home under the nominal
chaperonage of an elderly aunt, who performed
her duty to the perfect satisfaction of her nieces
by letting them do exactly as they liked. More
correctly speaking, perhaps, exactly as Helen liked,
for the younger of the two, Edith, a girl of seventeen
and four years her sister's junior, could hardly
be said to have likes or dislikes distinct from those
of Helen. Possibly Mr. Beaumont might not
have left the two to their own devices with so
easy a mind, had he not quitted home happy in
the knowledge of Helen's engagement to his
friend and neighbour Malcolm Willoughby. The
gentleman in question lived within a few miles of
our heroine's home, having succeeded some years
before to his father's property. His only sister,
Mrs. Lindsay, was at this time living with him
for a few months while awaiting her husband's
return from India, and though some years older,
was, next to her sister, Helen's most valued friend
and companion. Malcolm Willoughby was a
man of high character, peculiarly fitted, by his
unusual amount of sterling good sense, to be the
guide of an impulsive, enthusiastic girl like
pretty Helen Beaumont, whom to know was to
love, and who would have been altogether
charming but for her inordinate amount of self-will
and inveterate dislike to being, as she expressed
it, "ordered" to do or not to do whatever
came into her head. She and her sister had
real talent as artists, and their spirited and
well-executed landscapes bore but little resemblance
to the insipid productions of most young
lady painters. To improving herself in this
direction Helen had devoted much time and
labour. Unfortunately, it had so absorbed her
thoughts and desires that in its pursuance she
was inclined sometimes to forget what were for
her more important avocations. Helen's fortunate
engagement to Mr. Willoughby had for
some time past corrected these only objectionable
tendencies in her character, and all had gone
smoothly and happily till the date at which our
story commences, when, unluckily, some artist
friends had filled her head with their descriptions
of the exquisite autumn scenery, "effects
of foliage," etc., to be seen in a mountainous
and hitherto little explored part of Wales.
Her imagination, and through her that of her
sister Edith, ran wild on the subject, and now
nothing would satisfy her but a journey to the
spot in question, by themselves, in order that they
might enjoy their freedom to the utmost, and revel
in the delight of painting some of the wonderful
Welsh scenery described to them. The idea had
at first been mooted half in joke, but an impolitic
expression of strong disapprobation on the part of
Mr. Willoughby had done more to determine
Helen on carrying it out than all the anticipated
artistic enjoyment.</p>

<p>"It will be just the opportunity I wanted,"
thought the foolish girl, "of showing him that
I do not intend to be a silly nonentity of a wife
with no opinion of my own, and hedged in by all
the absurd old-fashioned conventionalities which
will not allow a woman to have an existence of her
own or give her opportunity to cultivate what
talents she may possess."</p>

<p>And once determined, Miss Helen remained
inflexible. In vain Mr. Willoughby remonstrated,
in vain even their indulgent old aunt expressed
her horror at the idea of "two young girls scouring
the country by themselves," her own feebleness
rendering her accompanying them out of the
question. Go to Wales Helen and Edith must,
and go they would, till at last the discussion with
her <i>fianc&eacute;</i> terminated in the disastrous manner
above recorded.</p>

<p>I will not undertake to describe Helen's
feelings, when, in the solitude of her own room,
she thought over what she had done. Had she
herself been obliged to put them into words, I
believe she would have repeated that she had not
acted in temper and that the stand she had made
for her womanly freedom, as she would have expressed
it, had been an act of supreme heroism
and devotion to the cause of right. She said all
this to herself and tried hard, very hard to believe
it; and to stifle the little voice at the very bottom
of her heart which whispered that she had behaved
like a silly, self-willed, petted child, and shown
herself undeserving of so good a gift as the
love of a man like Malcolm Willoughby. The
little voice was smothered for the time by exaggerated
anticipations of the delights of their tour
and attempted self-congratulations at her newly
regained liberty to do as she chose; for Malcolm
did not come near her again, and it took all her
pride to hide from herself and others the shock
she felt through all her being when, in the course
of a few days, she heard accidentally that Mr.
Willoughby was leaving home for an uncertain
length of time.</p>

<p>"He has taken me at my word," thought she,
"but of course I meant him to do so," and she
hurried on the preparations for their journey
which they were now on the eve of.</p>

<p>"You will at least take Maxwell," said Aunt
Fanny timidly.</p>

<p>"Maxwell, aunt! No, thank you," said Helen
ironically; "she would be crying for her spring
mattress the first night and thinking she was going
to die if she heard the wind howl. No, thank
you, I mean to be independent for once in my
life, and so does Edith."</p>

<p>Other twenty-four hours saw our two young
ladies on their way. Unaccustomed as they were
to travelling alone they got on very well for the
greater part of their journey, till they arrived at a
certain railway station in Wales, of name unpronounceable
by civilised tongue, but which sounded
to them like that of the place where they were to
leave the railway. Never doubting but what they
were right in so doing Helen and Edith calmly
descended from their carriage, watched the train
disappear in the tunnel hard by, and then began
to make inquiries for a conveyance to transport
themselves and their luggage, white umbrellas,
easels and all, the five or six miles which they
imagined were all that divided them from their
destination. A colloquy ensued with the most
intelligible of two or three fly-drivers, carmen,
or whatever these personages are called in Wales;
but what was Helen's consternation on learning
that fifteen miles at least remained to be traversed;
they having left the railway at Llanfar, two stations
too soon, instead of remaining in it till they reached
Llanfair, the point nearest to the farm-house where
lodgings had been taken for them. No chance of
a train to Llanfair till to-morrow morning, for the
line was a new one, and the traffic as yet but small.
No prospect of a night's accommodation where
they were. Nothing for it but to trust to the
driver's assurance that he and his unpromising-looking
horse could easily convey them to the
farm-house, with the inevitably unpronounceable
name. With some unconfessed misgivings Helen
and Edith mounted the vehicle awaiting them,
and drove off along a muddy, jolting lane into
the quickly gathering gloom.</p>

<p>Shivering on her uncomfortable seat, did Helen
wish herself at home again in her own little sitting-room,
with Aunt Fanny peacefully knitting, Edith
kneeling on the hearth-rug, and Malcolm's face
bright with the reflection of the ruddy log fire so
welcome in autumn evenings; all together as was
their wont, enjoying "blind man's holiday"?</p>

<p>I think we had better not press the question too
closely. However, "it's a long lane that has no
ending," and even this dreary journey gradually
drew to a close. They passed but few houses of
any kind, one or two straggling hamlets were left
behind, and for some two or three miles the road
had been perfectly solitary, when they suddenly
heard wheels advancing to meet them, and in a
few minutes a car like their own drove towards
them, and being hailed by their driver, drew up
at their side. A jabbering ensued of directions
asked and given, and they again drove on.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you know the way?" said Helen
timidly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, miss," the driver answered confidently,
and further informed them that the car they had
met, had just returned from their own destination
(being translated), the Black Nest Farm, having
there deposited a traveller who had taken the
middle course of leaving the railway at the intermediate
stoppage between Llanfar and Llanfair.
Other three-quarters of an hour and they pulled
up at last before a house which the darkness prevented
their seeing more of than that it was long
and low. They stumbled up the rough garden
path, and in answer to their knock, the door was
opened by a tidy, clean-looking old woman, with
a flickering candle in her hand, evidently surprised
at their appearance. She had, she said, quite
given up thoughts of their coming that night,
and feared the fire in the sitting-room was out.
Thankful to have reached the Black Nest at last,
a chilly room seemed a smaller evil than the two
girls would have considered it at home; and
after all, things were not so bad, for the fire in
the little farmhouse parlour, to which their landlady
conducted them, was not quite out, and a
little judicious coaxing soon brought it round.</p>

<p>Their hostess's and their own first idea was of
course <i>tea</i>. What a blessing, by the way, it is that
British womankind in general, high and low, rich
and poor, old and young, have this <i>one</i> taste in
common! Refreshed by the homely meal speedily
set before them, Helen and Edith proceeded,
under the guidance of the old woman (apparently
the only inhabitant of the house), and the flickering
candle, to inspect their sleeping apartment. The
result was not eminently satisfactory, for it struck
them as gloomy, ill-ventilated, and a long way from
their parlour, though but few rooms appeared to
intervene between the two. This puzzled them
at the time, but was afterwards explained by the
fact that Black Nest Farm-house had originally
consisted of two one-storeyed cottages standing at
some yards distance from each other, and which,
on becoming the property of one owner, had been
united by a long passage; which arrangement was
looked upon in the neighbourhood as a triumph
of architectural ingenuity. On returning to their
sitting-room Helen's eye fell on a door beside their
own which she had not before noticed, and she
inquired if that was a bedroom. To which the
old woman replied in the affirmative, but added
that they could not have it, as it and a small
sitting-room opening out of it were engaged by a
"strange gentleman". And besides this, she added,
the bedroom was not so desirable for ladies, having
a second, or rather third door to the outside of
the house. The only other room they could have
was so small that she did not think they would
like it, but they should see for themselves, and so
saying she turned towards a recess in the passage.
Helen followed her, but the flickering candle
suddenly throwing light in a new direction, she
gave a little exclamation of alarm at what appeared
at the first moment to be a very ugly grinning
portrait high up on the wall.</p>

<p>"It's only the clock, miss," said the old woman.
"Though, to be sure, it is quare," and as she
spoke she threw the light more fully upon the
object that had startled Helen, which she now
perceived to be a very antique clock, standing high
in a dark wooden case, and with the face she
had seen, peeping at you as it were from behind
the dial-plate. An ugly, coarsely painted face,
with a disagreeably mocking expression it seemed
to Helen; nor was it the only repulsive feature
in this very remarkable clock, for the artist
appeared to have outdone himself in the grotesquely
hideous devices at the bottom of the
dial. Death's heads, cross-bones, and other
equally unpleasant objects of various kinds,
curiously intermingled with a condensed solar
system, in which sun, moon and stars appeared
jumbled together haphazard. The general object
of the whole evidently being to bring before the
spectator the ghastly side of his future, and to
read him a wholesome, but certainly not attractive,
homily on the shortness of life, and the speed with
which time was ticking away. Helen felt half
fascinated by its hideousness.</p>

<p>"Dear me, what a very curious clock!" she
ejaculated, and the old woman repeated, with a
little inward chuckle at what she evidently considered
the admiration drawn forth by her heirloom:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sure it <i>is</i> quare."</p>

<p>An uncanny object it certainly was, and Helen
felt relieved that the room in its immediate
vicinity was so small as to be out of the question
for the accommodation of her sister and herself.
Re-entering the sitting-room she found poor
Edith looking so utterly worn-out that she proposed
that they should at once go to bed; which
they accordingly did, followed by the old woman
with offers of assistance. Passing the door of
"the strange gentleman's" room, they heard
sounds of some one moving inside, and Edith
sleepily remarked that she wondered what could
have brought a gentleman to an outlandish place
like the Black Nest, unless, like themselves, he
came to take views in the neighbourhood. Helen
pricked up her ears at this and inquired of Mrs.
Jones if their fellow-lodger was an artist. Mrs.
Jones thought not, but seemed unwilling to pursue
the topic of the strange gentleman further. In
rather a forced manner she changed the subject by
inquiring if the young ladies would like to hire
her pony while there, as it was rough walking, and
her grandson Griffith, the only other inhabitant of
the cottage, a little lad of twelve, could lead it
for them, and show them the way whenever they
chose. Helen gladly closed with the offer.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Mrs. Jones," she exclaimed "how
very lonely you must be living here with no one
but a little boy. Have you no near neighbours?"</p>

<p>"None nearer than three miles ma'am, for the
farm-men live at a distance, save old Thomas in
the last cottage you passed, but he is bed-ridden.
My widow daughter, Griffith's mother, was with
me till she took ill, two winters ago, and died
before the doctor could get to her. Yes, it is
lonesome like in winter to be sure. It's not
often that gentry like you, miss, care to be in
these parts so late in the year."</p>

<p>Further inquiries elicited that the nearest church
was a good five miles off, that there was no doctor
nearer than Llanfar, that the butcher only came in
the winter once a fortnight and that irregularly;
in consequence of which the Black Nesters had
often to depend upon their own scanty resources, the
roads being almost impassable in stormy weather.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it feels rather dreary, Helen?"
said Edith, as she was falling asleep.</p>

<p>"<i>Eerie</i>, rather, I should say," replied her sister,
"but that, you know, is the beauty of it. In the
morning, I daresay, it will look bright enough,
but I confess I do not like that clock. Listen,
can't you hear its ticking, faintly, even here, at the
end of that long passage?"</p>

<p>"What clock do you mean? I saw no clock,"
said Edith, but almost before Helen could answer,
her soft regular breathing told that she was asleep.
Helen however, could not so quickly compose herself.
She felt excited and vaguely uneasy; and when
she at last fell asleep, it was only to have her discomfort
increased, by absurd, yet alarming dreams.
With them all the ugly clock was grotesquely
intermingled. Sometimes it was herself, sometimes
Edith, and once Malcolm, whom she fancied
in some position of terrible peril, always associated
with the clock, and at last she awoke with a half-smothered
scream of horror at the most frightful
dream of all; in which the "strange gentleman,"
their fellow-lodger, was pursuing her with a veil
over his face, which just as he caught her fell off,
and disclosed, horrible to relate, the face on the
clock.</p>

<p>Edith started up as Helen convulsively clutched
her, and exclaiming, "What in the world is
the matter?" really thought Helen was going
out of her mind when she replied, "That horrible
clock;" and as she spoke, as if invoked, the clock
began to strike: "One, two, three, four," and so
on. "Is it never going to stop?" said Helen.
Poor Edith, half asleep still, listened with her.</p>

<p>"Edith, I am almost certain that clock struck
<i>thirteen</i>," said Helen in an awe-struck voice; and
then they heard a door shut at the end of the
passage.</p>

<p>"Helen, you have been dreaming, and you are
only half awake now," said Edith. "It is not
like you to waken me in this frightening way,
please let me go to sleep."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said Helen penitently, and
she too closed her eyes and tried hard to go to
sleep, which of course she did, as soon as she left
off trying, and had made up her mind to lie awake
till daylight.</p>

<p>The morning broke clear and fresh; and, as
Helen had said, things in general bore a very
different aspect to that of the night before. Indoors,
the quaint old house now looked simply
picturesque, and Mrs. Jones the <i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of a
cheery old hostess. Even the face of the clock,
when Helen pointed it out to Edith, seemed to
have lost its mocking grin, and to be merely
bidding them good-morning, with a comical smile
at the consternation it had awakened the night
before.</p>

<p>Out-of-doors they soon turned their steps.
There was no view from the house, but a short
voyage of discovery quickly explained to them
their locality. Black Nest Farm stood at the foot
of a hill close on to the high road, or what passed
for such in that hitherto little frequented neighbourhood.
On the opposite side of the road but
little was to be seen, as the meadows were soon lost
in a thick belt of wood; but immediately behind
the house was a tempting prospect, for there a
little winding path led up the hill to one of the
spots Helen and Edith most ardently desired to
paint, and of which their friends had given them
a glowing description. It was rather a long walk
to the Black Lake, Mrs. Jones informed them, but
their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and hardly permitted
them to do justice to their breakfast of
ham and eggs, home-made bread and home-churned
butter. See them then starting on their
expedition,&mdash;their painting materials, and some
creature comforts in the shape of sandwiches and
hard-boiled eggs, safely packed on the pony's back,
Griffith leading him and acting as guide. A pretty
stiff pull it was, enthusiasm notwithstanding, and
rather hard work for the little feet, sensibly shod
in good strong boots it is true, but unaccustomed
nevertheless to mountain scrambling. But at last
their circuitous path brought them to the summit,
and there a curious prospect broke upon them.
They stood at the edge of the great Welsh tableland.
There it stretched away before them, miles and
miles beyond their view; a vast expanse of wild,
brown moor, unrelieved by tree or shrub, but here
and there dotted by great patches of what Edith
at first sight took to be "lovely emerald moss".
Treacherous loveliness, for it told, as they learnt
from Griffith, of fearful bog-pits, down whose
slimy sides once slipped no man or beast could
ever regain firm ground.</p>

<p>"What a horrible death that would be," said
Helen, shuddering, "far worse than regular
drowning in clean water. It would be slow
suffocation in nasty, dirty mud."</p>

<p>A few minutes' careful walking brought them
in sight of the Black Lake, the special object of
their excursion. And it certainly was well worth
coming to see, if not to paint; probably too,
better seen in the greyness of a late autumn day
than in the summer sun, whose bright rays
reflected on its surface would have little harmonised
with its character of gloom and loneliness.
The lake was equal to several acres in
extent, but from where they stood could not all
be seen, as its farther end was hidden by the
undulations of the land. In colour it was a dull,
leaden grey, and looking at it, one's mind spontaneously
reverted to travellers' descriptions of
the Dead Sea, for <i>dead</i> was essentially the word
by which to describe it. There were no fish to
be caught in it Griffith told them, and as for
its depth he had never heard tell of any one's
sounding it. The effect of the whole scene was
very peculiar, and so Helen and Edith felt it to
be, as they stood gazing at the leaden water and
the great, apparently boundless moorland. It
was difficult to realise that they were so far above
the ordinary haunts of men, for there was nothing
in that great plain to remind them of the existence
even of hills and mountains, except a steady-blowing
breeze of that peculiar freshness pertaining
only to sea or mountain air. Pleasantly invigorating
at first, but soon becoming too chilly to
make one care to stand about, or, worse still,
to <i>sit</i>, as our young ladies now prepared to
do.</p>

<p>"We are very lucky in the weather," remarked
Helen, as they prepared for their sketching. "I
should fancy it is just the day to see the lake
to the best advantage."</p>

<p>"Or disadvantage," said Edith, "for I do think
it is the most horrible place I ever saw. I don't
know," added she dreamily, "but what it would
seem even more desolate on a bright, sunny day.
I don't know why."</p>

<p>"I understand how you mean," replied her
sister, "the contrast would be so strange. Like
a skeleton dressed in a golden robe. Dear me,
I am becoming quite poetical. But look, Edith,
how do you like this?" And a consultation on
their work ensued.</p>

<p>Very cold work it became, as it grew to afternoon,
notwithstanding the pleasurable excitement
of their occupation, and Edith, for one, was not
sorry when Helen at last thought it time to pack
up their painting materials and turn homewards.
A drizzling rain began to fall as they neared the
foot of the hill, and they both felt thankful to
reach the farm-house,&mdash;tired, muddy and damp,
and in not <i>quite</i> such high spirits as when they set
off on their expedition. A savoury odour meeting
them on their entrance, Helen suddenly bethought
herself that she had utterly forgotten to order
anything for their "high tea," or whatever one
likes to call the said incongruous meal. It was
therefore an agreeable surprise to her after
remembering her neglect to see on entering their
little sitting-room the brightest of fires, and the
table daintily set out with evident preparation for
a tempting repast; part of which, in the shape of
a delicious-looking ham, "a new-made pat of
butter and a wheaten loaf so fine," had already
made its appearance. Damp clothes and muddy
boots discarded, they sat down with an excellent
appetite to their meal, and the savoury odour
which had greeted them was soon explained by
the appearance of Mrs. Jones bearing a chicken
stewed in mushrooms.</p>

<p>"Mushrooms!" exclaimed Helen, "the thing
of all others I like. How clever you are, Mrs.
Jones, to get us all these good things! I shall
leave our food to your providing, I think, in
future."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones laughed and said a friend had sent
some things from Llanfar, and a friend also had
gathered the mushrooms, the last of their season,
thinking the young ladies might like them.</p>

<p>"Your friends are as good as yourself then,
Mrs. Jones," said Helen; but as she spoke she
was startled by what sounded like a half-smothered
laugh or exclamation of some kind just outside
the door. Almost at the same moment her friend
the clock began to strike, and she therefore fancied
the sound she had heard must have come from it.
"Its internal arrangements are, I daresay, as peculiar
as its outside," thought she to herself, and refrained
therefore from mentioning to Edith what she
thought she had heard. All the rest of the
evening, however, though she would hardly have
owned it to herself, she felt a little nervous and
uneasy, particularly when she heard the clock
strike.</p>

<p>"I wonder what our fellow-lodger does with
himself all day," said Edith that evening.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know, or care either," said
Helen, "indeed, I hardly believe there is such a
being at all."</p>

<p>They went early to bed, and fell quickly asleep.
After having slept, it seemed to her for several
hours, Helen woke suddenly with the feeling that
something had wakened her, and found that the
clock was busy striking, and to her confused fancy
had been striking for ever so long before she
woke. Its strokes ceased before she was sufficiently
awake to count them, but a moment or
two afterwards she heard a door shut as it had
done the night before.</p>

<p>"It is very annoying that I can't get a good
night's rest here," thought she. A whispered
"Helen," told her that Edith too was awake.</p>

<p>"The clock <i>did</i> strike thirteen," said Edith,
"and there <i>must</i> be somebody in that room, for
I heard the door shut again."</p>

<p>"And so did I," said Helen, whereupon they
lay still in awe-struck silence, till they both fell
fast asleep again.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and though somewhat
stiff and tired with their exertions, Friday's
programme was repeated. The sketches proceeded
satisfactorily, but our heroines were less fortunate
in other respects, for just as they were about to
leave the Black Lake in the afternoon, the rain
came on in torrents. Long before they got back
to the farm-house the poor girls were thoroughly
drenched. Edith escaped with no ill results, but
Helen sat shivering over the fire all the evening,
passed an uneasy night in which it seemed to her
that the clock never left off striking at all, and
woke on Sunday morning with every symptom of a
delightfully bad cold. The prospect outside was
not cheering. Rain, rain, rain. Down it came
in torrents. No chance of making their way to
the five miles' off church, no chance even of a
quiet stroll along the lanes; and, worst of all, no
books to read, for such a possibility as a whole
day in the house had never presented itself to their
inexperienced imaginations! It was very dull.
Helen was almost cross with Edith for being so
exceedingly sympathetic. It was kind of course,
but provoking nevertheless, as to Helen's sensitiveness
it seemed to convey a tacit reproach. She
would not allow to herself that they were at all to
be pitied. All the same she was not sorry when
the time came at last for them to go to bed.</p>

<p>"I wish we had brought some sherry with us,"
said Edith. "A little white wine whey would
have been the very thing for your cold."</p>

<p>"What's the good of wishing," replied her
sister rather snappishly, "you had better call
Mrs. Jones and ask her to make me some gruel."
But on Mrs. Jones's appearance, and when the
request had been made, both the girls felt rather
surprised at her volunteering the very thing they
had been wishing for.</p>

<p>She had, she said, "some very nice sherry wine,
given her by a friend," and many years ago, when
she was in service in Chester, she had learnt to
make white wine whey. Sure enough a tempting-looking
basinful shortly after made its appearance.</p>

<p>Thanks to its soporific influence Helen soon
fell asleep, but woke (as she had got strangely into
the habit of doing) just at midnight, or as Edith
had taken to calling it, "thirteen o'clock". The
clock was half-way through its striking when she
woke, and a sudden impulse seized her to jump up,
and, opening the door slightly, to peep out and
either see who it was that always shut a door after
the clock struck, or, by seeing nothing, satisfy herself
that the sound had all along been merely the
creation of her own and Edith's imagination.</p>

<p>She opened the door very cautiously, and
instantly perceived that there was a light at the
end of the passage in the recess where stood the
clock. Helen's heart beat more loudly, and she
wished devoutly that she had allowed her curiosity
to remain unsatisfied, when to her horror the light
moved out of the recess, and she saw that it was
held by a tall dark figure with its back turned
towards her. The passage was so long and the
light flickered so much that it was impossible for
her to distinguish anything but the general outline
of the person who held it. Not Mrs. Jones or
Griffith, assuredly, but poor Helen was too
frightened to do more than lock the door with
her trembling fingers and leap back into bed,
thereby awakening Edith, who on hearing Helen's
story calmly assured her that she had either been
dreaming, or had seen the strange gentleman their
fellow-lodger whose existence Helen had rashly
dared to question. Oddly enough she had forgotten
all about him, and felt somewhat relieved
by Edith's matter-of-fact solution.</p>

<p>"Only what should he be doing at the clock at
this time of night? I hope he is not out of his
mind;"&mdash;to which Edith replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do believe he gets up to make it strike
thirteen on purpose to tease us."</p>

<p>Monday morning wore a more promising aspect
than Sunday, for such clouds as there were,
bespoke nothing worse than showers, and our young
ladies succeeded in obtaining an hour or two's
sketching at the lake. Helen, however, felt still
considerably the worse of her terrible wetting, and
was actually the first to propose that they should
return to the farm-house. Somewhat weakened
by her cold, and tired too, she mounted the little
pony at Edith's suggestion, and they were proceeding
cheerily enough on their way&mdash;Griffith,
loaded with their painting materials, some little
distance behind&mdash;when a stumble on the pony's
part brought him suddenly to the ground. Helen
had been paying little attention to her steed, and,
unprepared for the shock, fell on her side with
some little force. A most undignified procedure
had there been any one to witness it, but which
would have drawn forth nothing but a laugh had
it not been that in the fall her foot caught in the
stirrup. Her sharp cry of pain terrified Edith,
who, however, soon succeeded in disentangling
her, as the poor little pony remained perfectly
quiet, but a moment's examination, and a vain
attempt to stand, showed them that the ankle was
badly sprained. All that could be done was to
mount Helen again as well as Edith and Griffith
could manage, and to make the best of their way
home. Arrived there, hot applications soon reduced
the pain, but it was easy to be seen, even
by their inexperienced eyes, that Helen must not
attempt to move for several days to come.</p>

<p>Here was a charming ending to their expedition!
Helen, even, felt woefully disconcerted,
and poor Edith fairly began to cry.</p>

<p>"If it were not that you would not like it, I
would write to Mrs. Lindsay to come and nurse
you," said Edith, "she is so good and kind, and I
know she would come in a minute, for she has
nothing to prevent her."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lindsay! Edith," exclaimed Helen indignantly,
"the very last person I would apply to,
however good and kind she may be. Do you
really think that. I would put myself under such an
obligation to the sister of the man I have<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"
"Quarrelled with for nothing at all," said the little
voice at the bottom of her heart. Edith said
nothing, but for the first time in her life took an
independent resolution and acted upon it. Her
love for Helen conquered her fear of displeasing
her. What this resolution was we shall not disclose,
nor shall we tell whose hand addressed a
letter to Mrs. Lindsay carried that evening by the
post-boy to Llanfar. The strangest coincidence
was that <i>two</i> letters bearing the same direction
left the Black Nest Farm that evening.</p>

<p>Tired out with the pain of her ankle, Helen,
for the first time since their arrival, slept past
midnight and only woke to hear the clock strike
five. All too soon for her comfort, for her
thoughts were none of the brightest, as she lay
waiting for the daylight. Her folly, her headstrong
determination, right or wrong, to carry out
her own way, began to show themselves to her
more clearly; or rather, she began to allow herself
to see them in their true light. And when at last
the morning came, and she was established
for the day on the hard little horse-hair sofa in
their sitting-room, her spirits were not improved
by the perusal of a letter from her Aunt Fanny.
The good old lady, after deploring their absence
and pathetically describing her anxiety on their
behalf, made mention of a visit from Mrs. Lindsay,
who had come to tell her how unhappy she was
about her brother. "He left home," wrote Aunt
Fanny, "two days after that unfortunate conversation
with you without telling his sister what was
the matter. At least she only gathered that something
unpleasant had happened from his saying
that you were leaving home, and that he did not
expect to see you before you went. He left
no direction beyond telling her to write to his
club, which she has done two or three times, but
got no answer. She says he looked so unlike
himself that she fears he has fallen ill somewhere
and cannot write to tell her. Oh, Helen, I do
wish you had never thought of this expedition."</p>

<p>"How very silly Mrs. Lindsay is to be so
fanciful," said Helen, in which view of the case
tender-hearted little Edith did not at all agree,
though she hardly dared to say so. They spent a
dull day, for Edith would not consent to leave her
sister, and their paintings were at a standstill for
want of another day's sketching from the original.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, Edith," said Helen, "you might
go to the lake for an hour or so without me and
finish your sketch, and I might go on with mine
from yours," to which Edith made no objection.</p>

<p>By night Helen's feverish uneasiness had increased,
and Edith secretly congratulated herself
on her resolute step of the day before. And a
wretched night followed. In reality Helen was
very anxious and unhappy about Malcolm Willoughby,
and her dreams were full of terrors that
something had befallen him. Through all, the
disagreeable clock again thrust forward its ugly
face, and she woke in an indescribable state of
horror, fancying that the clock was standing by her
bedside, striking loudly in her ears to a kind of
"refrain" of the words: "I told you so. I told
you so." Of course the clock <i>was</i> striking, and
had evidently awakened her by so doing.</p>

<p>"Thirteen again," whispered Edith, "it is
really very disagreeable."</p>

<p>"It sounds to <i>me</i> like the voice of my conscience,"
said Helen, "warning me that some
terrible punishment is coming upon me for my
wicked folly. Yes, Edith, I see it all now, and
as soon as ever I can move we shall go home, and
I shall ask poor Aunt Fanny to forgive me. I
wish every other consequence of my wrong-doing
could be done away with as easily as her displeasure."
And all her pride broken down, poor
Helen burst into tears, and Edith's affectionate
words of soothing were of no avail to stop her
sobs. She felt rather better in the morning
however, partly, perhaps, because the day was
bright and sunny. About mid-day she fell into
a doze on her sofa, and waking after an hour's
sleep was surprised to miss Edith. A note in
pencil pinned to the table-cover caught her attention.
It bore these words: "You are so nicely
asleep I don't like to waken you. I shall come
back as early as I can, but don't be alarmed if I
am a little later than you expect."</p>

<p>"She has gone to finish the sketch," thought
Helen uneasily. "I wish I had not asked her to
do so, it looks dull and overcast."</p>

<p>She rang the hand-bell for Mrs. Jones, who
appeared with a basin of soup, and told her that
the young lady had set off a quarter of an hour
before.</p>

<p>"It can't be helped now," said Helen, "but I
wish I had not proposed it."</p>

<p>The afternoon seemed long and dull, and yet
Helen felt sorry when it began to close in, for
no Edith had yet appeared. Still it was not later
than they had been out together more than once.
Helen tried to think it was not yet dusk outside,
but felt this comfort fail her when it gradually
grew so indisputably dark that Mrs. Jones brought
in candles without her asking for them.</p>

<p>"Are you not uneasy about my sister and
Griffith, Mrs. Jones?" said Helen; but her
anxiety was tenfold increased when Mrs. Jones
replied calmly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Griffith is not with the young lady to-day. I
had to send him a message to Llanfair, and as like
as not he will stay at his uncle's till the morning.
The young lady said it did not matter, and I
saddled the pony for her myself."</p>

<p>"Griffith not with her!" exclaimed Helen.
"Oh, Mrs. Jones, what will become of her?"</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, miss," said the old woman,
"the pony is very steady, and the darkness comes
on so sudden-like, it seems later than it is."</p>

<p>And with this scanty consolation Helen was
obliged to remain satisfied. Mrs. Jones stirred
up the fire and set the tea all ready, but Helen
grew sick at heart as the time went on, and still
no Edith. Six, struck the clock, and ticked on
again to seven. Helen could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jones," cried she, "can you not get any
one to go to look for my sister? She may be on
her way down the hill, and have got into some
difficulty with the pony."</p>

<p>"Indeed, miss, I don't know what I can do.
There's no one nearer than old Thomas and he
can't move."</p>

<p>"The strange gentleman!" said Helen suddenly;
"your other lodger. Would he not help
me?"</p>

<p>"He has been out since early this morning,"
replied Mrs. Jones, "and he told me he was not
sure of being back to-night. He has gone to
meet a friend."</p>

<p>Helen felt more in despair than before. It
seemed an aggravation of her anxiety to have to
lie still on the sofa doing nothing. Indeed had
she been able to do so, nothing would have prevented
her making her way to the Black Lake,
and too probably losing her own life in the endeavour
to save her sister's. As it was, she
managed at last to drag herself to the door in
hopes of hearing footsteps up the path, but nothing
broke the silence save the tick, tick of the clock.
It wore on to nine, despite her wretchedness and
indescribable anxiety. She pictured to herself her
sister, her dear little Edith, left so specially in her
charge, cowering on the moor, alone in that dreary
darkness, sobbing in despair of ever finding her
way out of that frightful desert. Or, worse still,
lying cold and dead in one of those fearful pits
under the mockingly beautiful moss; whence, in
all probability, her poor body even would never
be recovered. It was too frightful. Helen almost
shrieked aloud: "Oh, my darling, my little sister,
come back, do come back. Oh, Malcolm, if only
you were here. How terribly I am punished for
my self-will!" And terribly punished she was,
for the memory of that night's suffering was too
painful to recall in after years without a shudder.
Mrs. Jones was in helpless distress, though in
hopes of every moment hearing the pony and the
young lady at the gate, and she returned to her
own domains saying she had better have hot water
ready as Miss Edith would be fainting for her
tea. Helen remained alone at the window of the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>The night was fine but very dark. Darker
than she had ever seen a night before, it seemed to
Helen. She was almost in a stupor of despair.
She sank down half-unconsciously before the fire
and never knew how long she had lain there when
she was roused by the clock striking. "One, two,
three, four,"&mdash;she counted aloud as if bewitched,
till when it got to the fatal <i>thirteen</i>, her
over-strained nerves gave way, and with a scream she
ran or stumbled, she knew not how, along the
passage to seek for Mrs. Jones. As she passed
the front-door she was arrested by the sharp sounds
of steps coming quickly up the garden path. The
door was pushed open. The only light was what
came through the open door of the room she had
just left, and she could distinguish nothing but a
tall dark figure hurrying towards her. She
screamed with terror but stood, unable to move,
when to her intense relief a voice from behind the
person she saw, exclaimed eagerly: "Helen, dearest
Helen, don't be frightened. I am quite safe,"
and some one rushed past the tall person, now
close to her, and kissing her passionately, Helen
felt, rather than saw, that it was Edith.</p>

<p>"Malcolm! Malcolm! she is fainting!" called
Edith, and the tall person pressed forward, caught
her up in his arms like a baby, and, unconscious
now of everything, Helen was carried back into
the sitting-room, laid on the hard little sofa, and
there held tenderly by the strong yet gentle arms
whose protecting care she, poor foolish child, had
fancied she could so well dispense with.</p>

<p>It was the first time in her life that Helen
Beaumont had ever fainted, and it was not long
before she began to recover.</p>

<p>"Malcolm! oh, Malcolm!" were her first words
on returning consciousness (and it seemed to her
afterwards as if some one else had spoken them
for her, her good angel perhaps!), "can you
ever forgive me?"</p>

<p>"My darling," was the whispered answer, "you
know you need not ask it." And then Helen felt
as if she were just going to die, but was too happy
to care, and too languid to ask even how all this
had come about. But now a third person came
forward saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Malcolm, let me stay beside her," and, wonderful
to tell, the sweet voice and kind face were Mrs.
Lindsay's. Helen thought she must be dreaming,
but lay still as she was told, and then drank something
or other Mrs. Lindsay brought her; so
before long she was able to sit up and begin to
wonder what was the meaning of it all.</p>

<p>"Are you not amazed, Helen?" said Edith;
"but first of all you must forgive me for frightening
you so, for indeed I have been nearly as
wretched as you, thinking of what you must
have been feeling." And before Helen could
reply the eager girl ran on with her explanations.
"Who do you think has been our fellow-lodger
all this time, Helen? Who do you think is the
'strange gentleman'? Only fancy Malcolm's
having been here ever since we came! It was
he that travelled by the same train, and seeing as it
moved off at Llanfar that we had got out, he did
so at the next station, and arrived here before us.
He had inquired about Mrs. Jones, and heard
what a good creature she was; and he had time
to have a talk with her, and to take her to some
extent into his confidence."</p>

<p>Helen looked at first, as this recital went on, as
if she were wavering between a return to her old
dislike to being interfered with, and gratitude to
Malcolm for his undeserved devotion. The good
angel triumphed, as Malcolm, who was watching
her anxiously, quickly perceived.</p>

<p>"I did not interfere with you, Helen," he said
in a low voice, "but it was the greatest comfort
to me to be able to protect and care for you, even
though you did not know it."</p>

<p>The tears started to Helen's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Malcolm, I know how good you are,
but<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Never mind any 'buts,'" said Mrs. Lindsay
brightly, catching the last word. "'All's well,
that ends well.'"</p>

<p>"I know now who foraged for us so successfully,"
said Edith. "Who was the mysterious
friend that gave Mrs. Jones the mushrooms!"</p>

<p>"And nearly betrayed myself by laughing at
the door, when passing I heard Helen's enthusiastic
thanks to Mrs. Jones," said Malcolm.</p>

<p>"Yes, and frightened me horribly by so doing,"
added Helen, "as I really began to think that
clock was bewitched, and had a special ill-will
against me. In fact it took the place of my conscience
for the time being."</p>

<p>"I have the very greatest regard for the clock,"
said Malcolm demurely, "and I intend to make
Mrs. Jones an offer for it forthwith."</p>

<p>"Please don't," said Helen piteously. "I daresay
it is very silly, but I really don't quite like
that clock, though, after all, its warning of ill-luck
has brought the very reverse to me. But I have
not heard yet what kept Edith out so late, or how
in the world you and Mrs. Lindsay met her at the
Black Lake."</p>

<p>"The Black Lake?" said Mrs. Lindsay, "what
do you mean?"</p>

<p>Whereupon Edith hastened on with that part
of her story relating to her own adventures.
She, it appeared, feeling confident in Mrs.
Lindsay's ready kindness, and never doubting
but what she would at once respond to her
appeal by coming to nurse Helen, instead of
going to the Black Lake to sketch, as Helen
imagined, set off on the pony to meet her friend
at the station, having proposed to her to come by
a certain train. Overtaking Griffith on the road
to Llanfair, as she expected from Mrs. Jones's
account, he accompanied her to the village, where
she gave over the pony to his care. As she
entered the station she saw a return train about
to start for the Junction about half an hour's
journey from where she was. Finding by her
watch that she was in ample time, it struck her
that she might as well go so far to meet her
friend, but on arriving at the Junction she was
startled to find that with the new month a change
had taken place in the trains, and that consequently
Mrs. Lindsay could not arrive till late in
the evening. Worse still she herself could not now
get back to Helen till she was frightened to think
what hour, the evening train in question not going
farther than Llanfar, the station near the Junction
at which she and her sister had by mistake got out
on their arrival, and which was fifteen miles from the
Black Nest. It is needless to describe her distress
of mind all the long hours she had to sit in the
little waiting-room at the Junction; or her corresponding
delight when, on the train coming up, she
descried looking out of a window the familiar
face of Malcolm Willoughby, and found that he
was accompanied by his sister whom he had gone
to meet half-way on her journey.</p>

<p>Helen woke at noon the next day feeling
indescribably happy, she could not tell why till
the sight of Mrs. Lindsay's sweet face recalled to
her mind all her misery of the night before and
the relief and happiness with which it had ended.</p>

<p>"How little I deserve it!" thought she humbly
and gratefully, "and how can I ever repay Malcolm
for his goodness?"</p>

<p>Their dull little parlour looked very different
now that it was enlivened by the presence of the
two newcomers; and Helen could scarcely believe
it to be the same room in which, but yesterday, she
had passed hours of such agonising suspense. So
thoroughly penitent and softened did she feel that
she offered no opposition to anything proposed,
and it was therefore arranged that as soon as
Helen was well enough to travel they should all
return home together to relieve poor Aunt Fanny's
anxiety.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Helen, with a little sigh, a
few days afterwards, when they were packing up
their painting materials, "I wonder if I shall ever
finish my sketch of the Black Lake."</p>

<p>"I don't like to make rash promises," said
Malcolm, "but if somebody I know is <i>very</i> good
perhaps next summer she may see the Black Lake
again, provided she will neither catch cold nor
tumble off her pony."</p>

<p>Edith laughed and Helen blushed.</p>

<p>"But there's one thing still," said Edith,
"which I don't understand. Why, Malcolm, did
you always shut your door as the clock struck
thirteen?"</p>

<p>"Very simply explained," replied he. "The
first night I was here I was sitting up reading
till midnight and thought I heard it strike
thirteen. I thought it very odd, and for a night
or two I listened till it began to strike and then
opened my door to make sure I was not mistaken.
And one night I went out with my candle to
examine the clock, trying to make out the cause
of it, and to see if I could put it right. No man,
they say, can resist meddling with a clock even
though he is no mechanical genius."</p>

<p>"All the same," said Edith triumphantly,
"notwithstanding your examinations, you and no
one else can tell the reason why that clock does
strike thirteen."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
